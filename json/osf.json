        "abstract": "In March 2024, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved major changes to the ethnic and racial self-identification questions used by all federal agencies, including the U.S. Census Bureau. These modifications include merging the separate race and Hispanic ethnicity questions into a single combined question and adding a Middle Eastern and North African category. Government officials and researchers have requested evidence on how Americans might react to these changes. We conducted a survey experiment with a nationally representative sample of 7,350 adult Americans. Participants were randomly assigned to answer either the existing separate race and ethnicity questions or a combined question proposed by the OMB. We find that the combined question decreases the percentage of Americans identifying as White and as Some Other Race. We identify the key mechanism driving these effects: Hispanics decrease their identification in other categories when a Hispanic category is available in the combined question format. This results in statistically significant decreases in key minority populations, including Afro-Latinos and Indigenous Latinos.",

        "abstract": "There is a long-running debate on evaluating forecasts of rare events such as presidential elections. Recent scholarship has argued that forecasts cannot be evaluated on practical timelines and therefore do not provide reliable information. I argue the opposite: that a variety of statistical methods indicate that election forecasts can be evaluated in a timely manner, and that key forecasts that have survived many election cycles are likely to be informative.",

        "abstract": "Social media are frequently blamed for exacerbating ideological divides. We evaluate whether it is possible to design a social media platform that instead promotes productive, open-minded dialogue among users. We recruited 1,043 Americans who expressed willingness to test a new social media platform by installing a mobile app we developed for iOS and Android devices. Participants were randomly assigned to spend ten minutes on one of two versions of a simulated social media platform. The first was a control condition designed to resemble typical text-based social media sites, and users were told that people whose posts are liked very often receive a “popular user” badge. The second version was identical to the first, but respondents were instead told users receive an “open-minded” badge if they respectfully engage with opposing viewpoints. Participants using both versions were asked to join an ongoing discussion about either gun control or immigration. Unbeknownst to them, each participant only interacted with chatbots powered by generative AI. We find that respondents assigned to the experimental condition exhibited more intellectually humble language in their posts and comments and reported experiencing more positive emotions. We do not find significant treatment effects on participants’ self-reported intellectual humility, affective polarization, or issue attitudes. These results have important implications for future research on social media and social psychology and introduce new methods for conducting randomized controlled trials using generative artificial intelligence.",

This can take several forms, such as boycotts, buycotts, discursive actions, and lifestyle changes. Empirical studies reveal regional and individual differences in the prevalence of such behaviors, often linked to factors like active engagement in organizations, strong political beliefs, education level, and interest in politics.

This study examines the effects of horizontal education-job mismatch on organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and future career vision among employees from a medium-sized company in Japan using longitudinal personnel microdata and employee satisfaction survey data. The empirical results of this study show that horizontal education-job mismatch in a medium-sized Japanese company has a negative impact on employees’ psychological adjustment, even after controlling for individual-specific effects. The findings suggest that horizontal education-job mismatch has the potential for substantial economic, organizational, and individual costs, which is consistent with previous research in various global contexts.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the parental leave system at childbearing age is crucial for life after childbirth, regardless of gender. According to a 2021 UNICEF report, Japan has the best paid paternity leave policy in the world. However, the uptake rate of parental leave for Japanese male employees remains low compared to international averages. Many Japanese fathers may be underutilizing this benefit of this highly ranked parental leave system. Although there are several reasons for this, this study focuses on a lack of understanding of the particulars parental leave system. The empirical results of this study show that female employees possess more knowledge than their male counterparts and that the determinants of this knowledge differ between men and women. A worrying aspect of these results is the lack of opportunities for young male employees to improve their parental leave knowledge in the “lowest-low fertility” society of Japan. Future research is needed to try to identify new determinants of this knowledge to better understand and overcome the relationship of this problem to Japan’s low fertility rate.",

        "abstract": "This paper documents that the relationship between tariffs and growth varies significantly with economic structure. Using a panel of 161 countries from 1960 to 2019 and employing a local projections difference-in-differences strategy, I show that tariff reductions are associated with higher GDP per capita in manufacturer countries but lower GDP per capita in nonmanufacturer ones. I then reveal that these results are consistent with, and possibly explained by, heterogeneous changes in productivity, capital accumulation, and the manufacturing share of GDP. The heterogeneity is further confirmed by a comprehensive set of robustness checks. The findings suggest that the recent rise in protectionism in manufacturer countries might end up being harmful, and that existing calls for further liberalization in nonmanufacturers could have unintended consequences.",

        "abstract": "There is a longstanding interest in the link between economic conditions and fertility levels. Most research measuring economic development has focused on national-level patterns and period total fertility levels. This study aims to extend existing knowledge by carrying out a sub-national regional analysis of the link between economic conditions and parity-specific fertility, paying particular attention on the role of education. For this we look at three cohort fertility outcomes by women’s level of education: the share of women who remain childless, the mean number of children per mother, and the mean number of children per woman. As data source we use harmonized register, census, and large-scale survey data from 15 European countries. We focus on women born in the late 1960s and measure their fertility at the end of their reproductive career. This information we combine with the regional GDP per capita of their region of residence at that time. Our findings show that, conditional on having become a mother, cohort fertility associates with economic development positively at the country level among high-educated women, but not among low-educated women. At the regional level within countries, the negative association between economic development and fertility among mothers is weaker among women with higher levels of education. In contrast, childlessness tends to be higher in countries and in sub-national regions characterized by higher GDP per capita levels. These findings suggest that continued childbearing by highly educated women plays an important role in offsetting high levels of childlessness in countries and regions with favourable economic conditions in Europe.",

We focus on three prominent theories: organizational ecology, resource dependence, and organizational institutionalism. We develop comprehensive, period-specific dictionaries of each theory’s core concepts and apply them to articles in JSTOR’s sociology and management subject areas. We compare conceptual engagement to citations of foundational texts in Web of Science. We trace how these theories’ concepts evolved over time by capturing semantic similarity (within theories) and semantic distinctiveness (between theories). This computational method can simplify and accelerate literature reviews by allowing scholars to find which articles engage most strongly with concepts in specific theories and pinpointing which concepts articles engage with.",

        "abstract": "How do private companies justify taking on criminal justice functions? Building on writing on legitimacy and privatization, this article describes three rhetorical practices intended to increase the legitimacy of private companies carrying out criminal justice functions: softening (obscuring the use of force); shrinking (demonstrating deference to the state); and signaling (proclaiming alignment with pro-social values). The article demonstrates the analytic utility of these categories by considering public-facing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports produced by one prominent company in the private corrections industry (CoreCivic). The conceptual typology of legitimation work brings together several dynamics that are common in privatized criminal justice and provides an analytic toolkit for future study. A discussion considers how researchers can use this typology to examine legitimation work by other private firms and industries that engage the criminal justice system.",

Utilizando un análisis socioespacial con metodologías cualitativas y cuantitativas, la investigación se apoya en un Sistema de Información Geográfica (SIG) y bases de datos oficiales para demostrar la desigualdad en el acceso a bienes y servicios necesarios conforme a los Derechos Económicos, Sociales, Culturales y Ambientales (DESCA). Se reveló que las áreas más afectadas en cuanto al acceso a estos bienes y servicios son los asentamientos humanos irregulares y las zonas vulnerables. La interdependencia de los derechos humanos implica que la carencia de un derecho limita el pleno ejercicio de los demás. La investigación surgió de la necesidad de entender cómo ha aumentado la desigualdad socioespacial en Ciudad de México, donde en 2008 el 44.4% de la población vivía en pobreza, cifra que subió a 46.2% en 2014 (Coneval, 2016). A través de la experiencia voluntaria en Xochimilco, se observaron las distintas realidades y dificultades en el acceso a recursos y servicios básicos entre comunidades cercanas. Este estudio destaca la desigualdad espacial en el ejercicio de derechos y la necesidad de vincular los DESCA con la distribución de recursos.

Studies have explored predictors of populist attitudes, for example, personality traits, socio-demographic variables, and populist communication as well as on its consequences, such as the acceptance of democratic decisions and voting for populist parties. Thus far, evidence is mixed regarding the question of whether populism poses a threat to democracy or if it works as a democratic corrective.

        "abstract": "Motherhood is one of the most important sources of gendered labor market inequalities. Working mothers have less prestige, less authority than childless women and experience a substantial wage penalty. Scholars have highlighted the potential relevance of motherhood effects on job tasks in explaining motherhood penalties, yet little is known about how job tasks change due to motherhood. Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study and employing fixed-effects models, we study within-person changes in job tasks following childbirth. Deriving hypotheses from central explanations of motherhood penalties—work-family strain, human capital deterioration, compensating differentials—we examine changes in job tasks and how they vary with mothers’ working hours, length of time out, and occupational mobility. The findings show that mothers execute fewer analytic, complex, and interactive tasks; however, this penalty is mostly limited to mothers who reduce their working hours. The reduction in job tasks does not vary by occupational mobility nor by length of leave. Overall, these findings are consistent with explanations that focus on work-family strain, and provide additional evidence for the importance of improving job conditions and the care infrastructure to mitigate motherhood disadvantages in the labor market.",

The data for this paper is drawn from an online ethnography of two online communities, one for involuntarily celibate (or “incel”) men (incels.is), and the other focused on far-right politics and White supremacy (4chan.org/pol/). Using Link and Phelan’s (2014) Stigma Power framework, I demonstrate how members of these communities use knowledge and fact claims to keep people down (degrade and dehumanize others), keep people in (police in-group members and enforce norms), and keep people away (exclude others and mark them as dangerous). I argue that keeping people down, in, and away work ‘hand in glove’ to discredit and distance others based on fact claims. The paper aims to combine social psychological and science studies perspectives on stigma, while also demonstrating how the stigmatization of knowledge and fact claims can advance polarization and radicalization.",

More recent studies posit that distributed discovery (social media, news aggregators, search engines and messaging apps) and recommendation systems might be causing further information divides by reducing news attention, increasing knowledge resistance and decreasing awareness of others’ perspectives among certain online populations. Future studies should bring a more nuanced understanding of the development and implications of HCMEs by building on (a) news user repertoires (Strömbäck et al., 2018) or profiles research showing how a mix of news uses can contribute political learning, and also (b) systemic-equalizing approaches (Nir, 2012) that identify country-level factors favoring a more pervasive use of high-quality news.",

During the pandemic, online monitoring activists systematically collected, processed and published information from far-right Telegram channels and groups. Against the theoretical background of concepts like the monitory democracy and surveillance culture, we conducted eight semi-structured interviews with German online monitoring activists, investigating their motivations, roles, and the intricacies of their monitoring practices. Our findings reveal that online monitoring activists are driven by a sense of duty to counteract anti-democratic tendencies, which they perceive as inadequately addressed by institutional power. They gain localized and thematically specialized expertise that they share within loose networks of like-minded others. We highlight the activists’ liminal identity oscillating between virtuous citizenship and vigilantism, as well as the broader societal implications of their actions. On the one hand, they fulfill the role of active citizenship in the monitory democracy; on the other, they also reinforce the transparency imperative and the wish for far-reaching security and control inherent to surveillance culture. The transparency potential afforded by their adversaries’ online connective action and mobilizing efforts legitimizes their surveillance and demands surveillance. Further normative work is needed to critically examine the extent and desirability of increased social control introduced to liberal democracy by online monitoring activism.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the use of generative AI (GenAI) and research integrity assessments of use cases by researchers, including PhD students, at Danish universities. Conducted through a survey sent to all Danish researchers from January to February 2024, the study received 2,534 responses and evaluated 32 GenAI use cases across five research phases: idea generation, research design, data collection, data analysis, and writing/reporting. Respondents reported on their own and colleagues' GenAI usage. They also assessed whether the practices in the use cases were considered good research practice. Through an explorative factor analysis, we identified three clusters of perception: \"GenAI as a work horse,\" \"GenAI as a language assistant only\", and \"GenAI as a research accelerator\". The findings further show varied opinions on GenAI's research integrity implications. Language editing and data analysis were generally viewed positively, whereas experiment design and peer review tasks faced more criticism. Controversial areas included image creation/modification and synthetic data, with comments highlighting the need for critical and reflexive use of GenAI. Usage differed by main research area, with technical and quantitative sciences reporting slightly higher usage and more positive assessments. Junior researchers used GenAI more than senior colleagues, while no significant gender differences were observed.",

        "abstract": "This chapter examines the different channels operated by and for people with disabilities and how the participation of disabled citizen journalists contributes to the social construction of disability. Citizen journalists create several disability news websites, blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels, and other media forms every year, reaching a large and expanding audience. Further, many of these outlets can and do have an impact beyond the disability community, influencing legacy media and non-disabled audiences. The chapter will discuss historical events (e.g., the independent living movement, the introduction of closed captioning), as well as trade organizations focused on disability rights (e.g., the National Center on Disability and Journalism).",

        "abstract": "For a considerable period of time, peer review has been regarded as the cornerstone of academic journals and scientific communication, ensuring the high quality and reliability of published materials. However, in the early decades of the 21st century, a growing number of scholars began to challenge the traditional peer review procedure, questioning its efficacy. This study aims to provide a fresh perspective on the peer review mechanism, with the objective of enhancing the implementation of scientific communication's functionalities. The research employs historical analysis techniques and modelling methods based on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) to compare diverse review models in terms of their influence on scientific communication. BPMN is a conventional tool employed for modelling and describing business processes. The evolution of the peer review procedure is explored, encompassing an examination of the factors contributing to current and future transformations in the publishing realm. The author refers to the crisis of the conventional peer review system and the growing prevalence of preprints, serving as exemplars of these transformations. Finally, suggestions for the implementation of the post-publication review workflow in Russia are provided. Долгое время считалось, что рецензирование лежит в основе академических журналов и научной коммуникации, обеспечивая высокое качество и достоверность публикуемых материалов. Однако в начале XXI в. всё больше учёных стали сомневаться в традиционной модели рецензирования, заявляя о её кризисе. Цель настоящего исследования — предложить новый взгляд на рецензирование для полной реализации функций научной коммуникации. В исследовании используются методы исторического анализа и моделирования с использованием нотации BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), которая традиционно используется для моделирования и описания бизнес-процессов. Рассматривается эволюция института рецензирования, включая анализ предпосылок текущих и будущих изменений в издательском деле, к которым автор относит кризис традиционной модели рецензирования и распространение практики размещения препринтов. Сопоставляются различные модели рецензирования с точки зрения функций научной коммуникации, а также предлагаются рекомендации по применению постпубликационного рецензирования в России.",
