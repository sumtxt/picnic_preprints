        "abstract": "This article considers how \"self-imposed term limits,\" voluntary pledges by candidates for elected office to step down at the end of their term if elected or reelected, can arise endogenously within a formal model of electoral accountability. To this end, I extend a standard two-period political agency model with adverse selection by appending an election campaign during which two candidates compete with the option to commit not to seek reelection. I show that term limit pledges can emerge in equilibrium without commitment power, revealing their relationship with informative cheap talk. The subsequent analysis considers scenarios where commitment power is necessary for upholding term limit pledges. In these cases, self-imposed term limits allow strong candidates to signal their private type to voters, giving them an electoral advantage over those seeking reelection. However, these candidates' appeal comes not from the informational content of their pledges but from their ability to make policy decisions free from career considerations. I characterize the equilibria of a model specification in which politicians have differing policy preferences, identifying conditions under which term limit pledges are simultaneously informative and improve voter welfare.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel four-dimensional analytical framework to examine how universities are positioned within national artificial intelligence strategies amid intensifying geopolitical competition. Through systematic document analysis of policy frameworks across eight major global actors—the United Kingdom, Russia, India, the European Union, China, the United States, BigTech, and UNESCO (n=1,836)—we identify distinct governance typologies that determine higher education's role in AI ecosystems. Our findings quantify significant variations in how universities are instrumentalized across governance contexts—from talent pipelines in market-led systems to state-directed innovation hubs in centralized approaches. We document the emergence of value-aligned \"strategic education blocs\" replacing universal academic networks, with India demonstrating unexpected leadership in education-specific policy provisions. This research advances theoretical understanding of \"technological statecraft\" in higher education, demonstrating how the interplay between sovereignty concerns, regulatory philosophies, value systems, and public-private dynamics creates systematically different operating environments for universities across geopolitical contexts. These findings provide critical benchmarks for understanding institutional positioning in the global AI landscape and challenge conventional internationalization frameworks in an era of technological nationalism.",

        "abstract": "This paper seeks to identify the common characteristics of socialist thoughts. Using “A history of socialist thought from the precursors to the present” by Mukherjee and Ramaswamy (2000) as data, this paper utilizes qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) method to find the combination of characteristics that make up socialist thoughts, and political compass to visualize the positions of socialist thoughts. These common characteristics are categorized into groups of Goal and implementation, International view, Politics, Economy, Society, Democratic institution, Revolutionary action, and Revolutionary forces. Among them, Politics, Society, and Revolutionary action groups can be considered to have causal relationship with socialist thoughts. Most socialist thoughts are on the Libertarian left quadrant of the political compass. The methods in this paper have the potential to combine the strengths and limit the weakness of both qualitative and quantitative methods in more comprehensive research of socialist thoughts, for better application of socialism in practice in the future.",

        "abstract": "Most of the studies and debates on liberal democracy in literature are centred around what goes wrong with liberal democracy and how to remedy it. However, there is little attention on oriental practice of democracy or viable alternative to western democracy. In this paper, a study is made on ancient Chinese thinking and practice of democracy. It is found that the first democracy was born in China more than 4,000 years ago. As a result of the discovery, a practical framework called Yao-Shunism is formulated and presented. Yao-Shunism offers non-partisan politics and participatory governance. It is backed by major Chinese philosophies and provides a viable alternative to existing political practice. It is shown that the entire world can benefit from Yao-Shunism if implemented. We demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of Yao-Shunism through George Washington.",

        "created": "2025-03-13",
        "abstract": "Climate change represents a profound theoretical challenge for IR and adjacent disciplines. It consists simultaneously of a series of disasters, in need of repair and redress, and a creeping unjust structural condition—a new normal with growing pernicious effects that transcend borders, recur over time, and disproportionately burden marginalized communities. Though scholars have developed frameworks for assessing both the episodic and structural aspects of climate change, they have failed to grasp their entangled, compounding effects. To address this gap, we theorize dual vulnerability to climate change as a unique position in debates over climate justice. We do so by drawing on Iris Marion Young’s dichotomy between interactional and structural injustice, but integrating her models to highlight how distinct forms of injustice reinforce and compound each other. The dually vulnerable, we argue, are not merely victims of catastrophic climate events, but also the most disadvantaged by the uneven global playing field climate change creates. The concept of dual vulnerability contributes to IR by highlighting the complex entanglement of discrete environmental damages and structural climate injustice, as well as how the dually vulnerable face a temporal challenge of simultaneously pursuing backward-facing compensation and forward-facing collective reparation action. To highlight our concept’s utility, we apply it to analysis of the UNFCCC’s recently created Loss and Damage Fund.",

        "authors": "Dianyi Yang",
        "created": "2025-03-10",
        "abstract": "Since 2022, central bank losses have been prevalent in advanced economies due to previous quantitative easing and recent inflationary pressures. This paper focuses on the unique case of the United Kingdom, where the government promised in advance to cover any central bank losses arising from quantitative easing. This promise is known as the indemnity. A game-theoretical model is proposed to explain the causes and effects of such indemnity. The model's predictions about the indemnity's effect on central bank profitability are empirically examined. Using the novel Dynamic Multilevel Latent Factor Model (DM-LFM), the indemnity is found to have significantly boosted the Bank of England's profits in the deflationary environment after 2008, but exacerbated its losses under the recent inflationary pressure since 2022. The theoretical model suggests the pronounced effects are due to the Bank of England's high sensitivity to losses and the UK government's moderate fiscal liberalism. Therefore, the British experience should not be generalised. Nevertheless, the theoretical and empirical lessons can inform policy-makers about future institutional designs concerning the fiscal-monetary interactions and the public finance-price stability trade-off.",

        "authors": "Yuhan Fang, Kohei Kawaguchi",
        "created": "2025-03-11",
        "abstract": "In response to growing privacy concerns, many browsers have implemented restrictions on third-party cookies and cross-site tracking in online advertising. Advertisers are concerned that such retargeting prohibition policies could lead to a reduction in ads' click probability, thereby affecting the bid values. This paper investigates the economic consequences of prohibiting retargeting in online advertising by analyzing data from a demand-side platform (DSP). Our analysis shows that the DSP's bid values for non-retargeted impressions on Google Chrome are more than 60\\% lower than those for retargeted impressions. Yet this difference understates the true disparity in bid values, as retargeting status is observable only for internal auction winners. By modeling the internal auction process and estimating advertisers' valuations, we identify even larger differences between retargeted and non-retargeted impressions: 76.04% for Android and 71.40% for Windows. Our counterfactual simulations indicate that a complete ban on retargeting would substantially reduce expected bid values—by 30.06% for Android and 49.84% for Windows users. These results underscore the significant economic tradeoff between enhancing privacy protection and maintaining advertising market efficiency.",

        "abstract": "This research identifies the causality between entrepreneurial behaviour and informal institutions of social trust within the context of China’s development. Revisiting the Polanyi-Schumpeter theoretical framework, entrepreneurship embedded in social relations interlinked by trust is a dynamo of sustainable socioeconomic progress. The institutionalised trust, however, was not clarified. With micro-individual data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2011–2021, our research employs the instrumental variable approach rooted in historical rice farming to tackle endogeneity. The results demonstrate that social trust elevates entrepreneurial engagement by 32.65 and 10.37 percentage points in self-employment and business incorporation, respectively. Increased trust paradoxically hampers self-employment in the central due to insular networks and structural disparities. The findings uncover the nuanced role of social trust in facilitating and constraining entrepreneurship with contextually regional determinants. The research contributes to knowledge and evidence of institutional endowments that mediate entrepreneurial agency and argues for synchronising formal and informal institutions in development.",

        "created": "2025-03-06",
        "abstract": "Social norms, understood as shared expectations of appropriate behavior, can help resolve collective action problems by making salient collectively beneficial equilibria. However, achieving long-lasting behavior of this type has so far challenged policymakers. To make progress, we need a deeper understanding of the dynamics of people’s normative expectations regarding collectively beneficial behaviors. This study employs a controlled laboratory experiment to collect panel data on individuals’ normative expectations regarding contributions in a public goods (PG) game. Using the Krupka &amp; Weber’s 2013 method, we elicit participants’ normative expectations at three stages: before playing a repeated standard PG game, after completing the repeated PG game, and after playing a repeated PG game with social incentives activated through the threat of exclusion from non-financial group activities. By comparing these stages, we examine whether and how experienced group behavior in PG games within two distinct structured social contexts—one without and one with social incentives—shapes individuals’ normative expectations. Our findings indicate heterogeneity in how social norms are perceived and how normative expectations change in response to experienced group behaviors in the PG games. Normative expectations for socially beneficial actions tend to emerge when such group behavior conveys a normative signal (i.e., when non-financial social incentives lead to increased and sustained contributions), particularly when the social norm is initially perceived as being loose. This work contributes to the growing body of research on social norms by offering experimental evidence that advances our understanding of the factors that determine beneficial normative change.",

Both help map circulation spaces and understand their operational logic, aiming to visualize the proximities and/or distances between different places/actors in the production of these symbolic goods. *Accordingly, based on several datasets collected to analyze the dynamics that structure contemporary French-speaking Swiss theater production circulation, this article aims to constitute a practical case on the combined use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Geometric Data Analysis (GDA) in mapping cultural spaces in a cross-fertilization perspective. The implementation of a mixed SNA and GDA analytical approach reveals distinct clusters of venues based on linguistic boundaries, size, cultural legitimacy, and audience reach. It identifies an “intermediate” subspace, between avant-garde and commercial productions. The study highlights methodological advantages in integrating SNA and GDA for developing a nuanced view on cultural dynamics, especially in understanding the career landscape of Swiss “ordinary” artists who navigate between artistic autonomy and market demands.",

        "abstract": "While the fundamental link between place and inequality is well investigated, causal studies on neighborhood effects are limited. Using nationwide administrative data from Germany and a quasi-experimental identification approach, we investigate how employed network ties and role models in the residential neighborhood shape individual-level employment. In exploiting variation over time, within cities and between 1x1 kilometer grid cells, we provide a causal estimate of gendered neighborhood employment effects on refugee women's employment probability. Results support direct job referral effects of full-time employed female neighbors, which is most potent for other neighborhood women from refugee countries. Analyses of locally prevalent female work norms show a positive one-off effect of higher part-time employment shares of native neighbors indicating that neighbors serve as role models only before other structures are settled. In analyzing neighborhood effects by sex and nationality, our study reveals that even weak neighborhood ties can provide valuable resources for disadvantaged social groups in the labor market. Hence, the study stresses the necessity to break down dichotomies such as gender and ethnicity when not only explaining but also finding alternative pathways for circumventing combined hurdles of intersectionality.",

Findings reveal center-based ECEC as the most effective in reducing social disparities, benefiting children from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Conversely, exclusive parental care and family day-care widen disparities, favoring higher socio-economic groups while negatively affecting those from lower ones.

Using linked administrative data from Wales (UK), we fill this gap by comparing age-16 attainment between children looked after (CLA, i.e. in out-of-home care), children in need (CIN), and children with no social care. Our findings show that White, Mixed-heritage, and Asian CIN have substantially lower attainment compared to children with no social care, but not for Black and Other ethnicity. Among Asian, Black, and Other-ethnicity children, CLA performed substantially worse than CIN. These findings question how accurate social care services’ identification of need is for Black and Other-ethnicity children and suggest that out-of-home care may be less effective for most ethnic minority groups.",

        "abstract": "Preventing undesired pregnancies in different-sex relationships requires ongoing actions and decisions from both partners. However, the burden of contraception is not equally shared. Most modern contraceptive methods are designed for female bodies, and women are typically responsible for managing contraception, from obtaining prescriptions to dealing with side effects. This contraceptive labor encompasses financial, time, physical and emotional costs – forming an often-overlooked aspect of unpaid labor that parallels housework and childcare in its gendered distribution. Using 2021 data from the German Family Demography Panel (FReDA), we build on the “ContraIndex” to quantify the costs and risks of different contraceptive methods. Situating contraception within the framework of the gendered division of labor, we examine how women’s relative resources and gender ideology shape their contraceptive labor using OLS-regression techniques. Our findings suggest that higher-educated women use contraception requiring more contraceptive labor, while those working equal or greater hours than their male partners perform less contraceptive labor. Traditional gender ideology is linked to higher contraceptive labor, also for women who inherit higher relative resources than their male partners. Our results highlight a complex interplay between within-couple predictors and contraceptive behavior, underscoring the need for further research on contraceptive labor as an overlooked dimension of gender inequality.",

One growing line of research examines how climatic and environmental exposures in early life affect later-life outcomes, which can occur through biological, developmental, and socioeconomic mechanisms. We contribute a historical perspective to this literature by leveraging unique, linked census data from early twentieth-century America (1900-1940). We match these data to historical temperature and precipitation estimates from the PRISM project at the county level. We then fit a series of regression models to measure the effects of exposures to temperature and precipitation anomalies in utero and during early childhood (i.e., the year before birth through age 5) on migration, marriage, labor force participation, and occupational prestige for men in early adulthood (i.e., ages 20 to 24). Our results show that temperature is positively associated with labor force participation and occupational prestige but negatively associated with the likelihood of marriage. Precipitation is positively associated with occupational prestige and negatively associated with marriage. Temperature and precipitation exposures are not significant predictors of migration prior to stratification. Additional models test for effect heterogeneity, revealing differences by region, farming status, and race. These findings underscore the complex and varied ways in which early-life climate exposures shaped socioeconomic trajectories in early twentieth-century America.",

Changes in general ideal fertility, however, may be hidden by omitting nonnumeric ideals. Using GSS data, I analyze trends in and predictors of nonnumeric fertility ideals between 1975-2022. I further examine ideals for a subset nudged for numeric responses. Findings underscore a spike in nonnumeric ideals (9% in 1975 to 23% in 2022) paralleled by a waning two-child ideal. Shifts to web-surveys account for some of the growth, but nonnumeric ideals increased even when only examining interviewer-surveys (9% to 15%). Notably, when nudged, nonnumeric respondents offer nonnormatively high or low numeric ideals. Nonnumeric predictors also point towards two groups likely to give opposed extreme ideals (e.g., high and low gender role and sexuality attitudes, frequent religious attenders and non-attenders). Over time, those with large-family ideals may have initially drove nonnumeric responses, with a bifurcated pattern emerging later. The high and increasing proportion of nonnumeric ideals may suggest a shift from broadly held two-child norms toward bespoke smaller families that facilitate self-actualization emerging alongside a continuing counterweight favoring large families. Like work on nonnumeric personal fertility preferences, attention to nonnumeric normative ideals offers insights into fertility decision-making.",

Aiming to foster collaborative scientific discourse, we introduce the prototype of an observatory with over 40 published Covid-19 studies and a selection of public responses for each study. Through several case studies from the observatory, we examine specific instances of methodological flaws, data integrity issues, and challenges of maintaining scientific rigour that were uncovered in these responses. While the prototype demonstrates the potential for creating a crowd-sourced comprehensive repository of post-publication reviews, it also reveals limitations such as resource constraints and the complexities involved in selecting and presenting articles and responses.

        "created": "2025-03-07",
        "abstract": "Increasingly researchers are assessing the causal effects of procedurally just treatment by police on public attitudes using experimental vignettes across the world. However, there are two key limitations to this body of research, particularly when drawing causal conclusions about theoretical mechanisms. The first is that most research on procedural justice, and particularly using experimental vignettes, has been conducted in countries with similar roots in policing (i.e., Anglo-Saxon, English-speaking countries). The second limitation is that research on procedural justice theory using vignettes often fails to closely assess the mechanisms and potential confounds linking experiences of treatment and subsequent attitudes. The current study aims to address both of these gaps by replicating US experimental vignettes among a representative sample of Dutch residents. Specifically, we field a 3x2x2 between-subjects vignette to assess different components of procedurally just treatment by police on individual attitudes during a traffic stop. We assess causal assumptions using a series of follow-up questions about placebo characteristics, and investigate underlying mechanisms by analysing open-text responses following each police legitimacy item. The results from the current study show that, while procedurally just treatment by police was statistically related to perceptions of encounter-specific police legitimacy, the strength of the causal effect and underlying mechanisms were not so clear. Not only was a key causal assumption violated, indicating that the effect does not run only through the treatment, but respondents suggested that they would comply and trust police in the situation based on broader societal norms and expectations, not necessarily because of police behavior. Methodologically, our study suggests that researchers using experimental vignettes need to pay more attention to causal assumptions. Theoretically, our study shows that those interested in testing procedural justice theory (and criminological theories more broadly) must think critically about identifying and evaluating competing mechanisms in different societal and institutional contexts.",

        "abstract": "In January 2023, Louisiana enacted Act 440, requiring websites containing substantial adult content to verify users’ ages through government-issued identification or commercial verification services. Since the passing of this legislation, 17 additional states have adopted similar laws. Using Google Trends data and a preregistered synthetic control design, this paper examines the impact of these age verification requirements on digital behavior across four key dimensions: searches for the largest compliant website, the largest non-compliant website, VPN services, and adult content generally. Our analysis reveals a 46.6% reduction in searches for the dominant compliant platform, accompanied by significant increases in searches for both the dominant non-compliant platform (48.1%) and VPN services (34.2%). Through multiverse analyses that incorporate multiple specifications and control group constructions, we demonstrate the robustness of these behavioral changes. Our point estimates remain consistent with our pre-registered hypotheses across 3,200 point estimates. Our findings highlight that while these regulation efforts reduce traffic to compliant firms and likely a net reduction overall to this type of content, individuals adapt primarily by moving to content providers that do not require age verification. Our methodological approach offers a framework for real-time policy evaluation in contexts with staggered treatment adoption.

        "abstract": "Despite strong evidence supporting sexual education, the Dutch national week of primary school-based sexual education sparked online controversy in 2023. This study examines the discourse surrounding this debate by analyzing social media posts (2022–2023) and newspaper articles (2005–2024) using topic modeling. Topic modeling is a machine-learning method that identifies patterns and themes in large text corpora. Among 2,095 newspaper articles, we identified five topics, revealing that while sexual education in Dutch primary schools has consistently been portrayed as beneficial, it has become increasingly contested over time. Newspaper coverage grew rapidly in 2023, with opposing viewpoints receiving more attention since 2018. The 10 topics identified in the analysis of 3,091 social media posts reflected this trend, highlighting polarization between conservative and progressive groups. Debates centered on age-appropriateness, the inclusion of controversial topics such as pleasure and LGBTQ+ issues, and the role of schools in sex education. We conclude that to increase public support for primary school-based sexual education, schools should prioritize transparent communication and direct engagement with parents to address concerns and counter misinformation circulating on social media.",

Utilizing a qualitative, exploratory approach, data was gathered through a Scopus database search and supplemented with relevant literature on AI and innovation management. Findings reveal that AI-driven assessments based on data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling significantly benefit SMEs by offering actionable insights and recommendations, enabling efficient decision-making, and promoting competitive dynamism. However, limitations such as data quality, algorithmic bias, and privacy concerns must be carefully managed to avoid potential risks associated with AI implementation. The study discusses the impact of AI on reducing the \"innovation divide\" by democratizing access to advanced innovation management tools, thus supporting SMEs in achieving strategic growth and market adaptability. This research concludes that AI-driven tools represent a valuable asset for SMEs, bridging gaps in consultancy access, and fostering economic inclusivity.",

However, the impact of closing such projects, especially on non-communicable disease (NCD) care in conflict-affected settings, is rarely examined from both patient and staff perspectives. This article explores how national staff navigate the ethical challenges of medical humanitarianism and the tension between humanitarian principles and biomedical ethics during project closure. Through an examination of an international humanitarian paediatric thalassemia unit (2018–2023), I examine national staff experiences of power dynamics, continuity of patient care, and the ethical challenges of withdrawal. Based on four years of participatory ethnography-by-proxy, findings reveal how hierarchical decision-making fosters moral distress by association among national staff. Using inductive sociological analysis, this article highlights the ethical and emotional tolls on national staff, who mediate between affected families and inequitable power structures. These insights underscore the need for continuity-focused, localized approaches in humanitarian NCD care, proposing recommendations to better align organisational practices with the realities faced by national staff and their thalassemia patients. This work advances discussions on localization, advocating for more equitable, context-sensitive humanitarian healthcare frameworks.",

        "abstract": "This commentary critically examines Jesper Sørensen’s Why Cultures Persist: Toward a Cultural Immunology, which applies a complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective to cultural persistence and transformation. Sørensen introduces the metaphor of a \"cultural immune system,\" paralleling biological immunity to processes of cultural regulation, resilience, and adaptation. While this metaphor provides an interesting lens for understanding social dynamics, we argue that it lacks structural precision, empirical support, and integration with other complex systems frameworks. The book's strengths lie in its emphasis on distributed biological metaphors, the CAS framework, the Free Energy Principle, and the notion of ritual as a key constitutive element. However, it falls short by inadequately considering the interlocking effects between metabolism, reproduction, and immunity, failing to provide a theoretically usable definition of \"interaction sphere,\" and insufficiently connecting to relevant complex systems research across various fields. Moreover, it risks overextending a limited metaphor, leading to potential misapplications. Sørensen’s work would benefit from incorporating network theory, systems theory, and game theory to provide a more rigorous explanatory framework. We question whether \"cultural immunology\" offers substantial conceptual breakthroughs or merely repackages existing insights under a novel terminology. The absence of precise models and empirical validation further limits its theoretical utility. Additionally, cultural persistence likely depends on multiple biological and social analogies—metabolic, reproductive, and nervous system models may be more relevant than immunity alone. Ultimately, while Sørensen’s work is ambitious and thought-provoking, it falls short as a comprehensive model of cultural evolution. Future research should seek greater precision and empirical grounding, avoiding the pitfalls of overly broad metaphors in explaining cultural dynamics.",

Despite having declared the death of functionalism, some form of functionalist argument still remains cryptically present in much substantive research. We argue that this inability to talk plainly about functions is a major hindrance for theory building in the discipline. As such, this article has two goals. The first is disambiguation. What does it mean to attribute a function to something? We answer this question by elaborating on the distinction between proper functions (responding to why-is-it-there questions) and role functions (responding to how-does-it-work questions). The second is to introduce a typology of functional arguments that builds upon this distinction. This allows us to recast “functionalism” as a set of general explanatory strategies and not as a substantive theory about society. This framework enables us to better evaluate, challenge, and improve upon much of the sociological research that currently relies on these forms of argument. Importantly, these forms of argument are not burdened with the problems associated with the organicist framework many sociologists have in mind when they think of functionalism.",

A mixed-methods approach combining rule-based VADER sentiment analysis and thematic evaluation was used to analyze user feedback to elucidate platform-specific advantages and systemic challenges. Results indicate DeepSeek was perceived as highly positive overall by users (+0.80 aggregate sentiment) as well as high scores for Accessibility (+0.93) and Intelligence &amp; Reasoning (+0.88). Nevertheless, emerging criticism revolved around its Censorship and Content policies (-0.20). The users applauded analytical accuracy through free access but criticized the interface navigation issues. Thematic analysis pinpoints DeepSeek as affluent with analytically driven users while emphasizing its highly tenacious capacity towards domain-specific problems. However, Cross-cutting challenges include latency, stability, and the inherent tension between content moderation and user autonomy. The AI evaluation frameworks are methodologically advanced by adding computational sentiment tools and qualitative perceptions. The intuitions from these findings allow for a better understanding of the user experience and have profound implications for the current development and practical usability of DeepSeek. The relationship between functional specialty and user expectations equates the competitiveness of AI platforms with DeepSeek, seen as a robust, free analytical tool while signaling possible areas for strategic enhancements.",

One type of food waste – uneaten food left behind on plates at the end of a meal – is unnecessary because it does not improve the dining experience. This study explores two enjoyment-based interventions aimed at reducing plate waste at hotel buffets. The first intervention (“sweet delight”) offers guests a chance to win a luxury dessert for finishing all the food on their plate. The second intervention (“flipper”) involves giving away to hotel guests who leave no plate waste a token for a game of flipper (pinball). In a manipulation check survey experiment, we test whether the two interventions increase positive emotional engagement (i.e., enjoyment, enthusiasm, excitement) and compare stated behavioural intentions to a control condition (no intervention). The “sweet delight” condition passes the manipulation check but does not increase intentions to leave no plate waste. The “flipper” intervention did not pass the manipulation check. A field study at a Slovenian hotel showed that “sweet delight” significantly reduced plate waste generated per hotel guest at dinner. The “flipper” intervention failed to change plate waste behaviour significantly. Findings point to enjoyment-based incentives as a promising avenue for behaviour change interventions aiming to trigger pro-environmental consumer behaviour. The “sweet delight” intervention tested in this study is available for immediate deployment by hotels that wish to reduce plate waste.",

        "abstract": "Current research funding systems are subject to structural imbalances, where formal criteria such as the H-index and the number of publications dominate over the potential and actual scientific prospects of researchers. This leads to the suppression of potential breakthrough research directions and limited access to grants for stochastic (innovative) researchers. In this paper, we propose a dynamic agent-based model of research grant redistribution that takes into account the adaptive mechanism of funding redistribution on the basis of the quality of stochastic research. The simulation was conducted on a sample of 21,534 Kazakhstani researchers with 30 iterations, during which the growth of the formal features of stochastic scientists was analyzed under different grant distribution scenarios. A grant redistribution parameter λ was introduced, which controls adaptive funding. The results showed that at λ=0.15, stochastic scientists begin to catch up with formal scientists in terms of productivity without destabilizing the scientific system. On the basis of the data obtained, a principle called the Haderach principle was proposed. It consists of a dynamic balance between formal (stable) and stochastic (informal) science. The developed approach can be used to optimize grant systems, allowing the elimination of barriers to new scientific directions and potential achievements without losing the stability of traditional schools. New concepts and terms of scientific vocabulary are introduced: the Haderach principle, excluded science, supplemented science, grant monopoly, and so on.

However, these percentages were computed incorrectly. Data from the NSFG are re-analyzed, ensuring comparable sample universes by age, correctly applying sampling weights, and including data from 2002. Following a small decline between 2006 and 2015 (10.7%-12.1%), the percent of men who were childfree between 2015 and 2019 (14.2%-15.7%) returned to the levels observed in 2002 (14.3%). Bozick's (2023) original conclusion, that the percentage of men who are childfree has grown considerably, is inconsistent with these revised analyses.

We used Multistate Markov models to analyse longitudinal data from the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to quantify the probability of transitioning between stages of educational attainment over time by race and ethnicity (Black, White, Hispanic and ‘Others’), sex and household income. We found large inequalities across both time periods in educational attainment between race and ethnicity groups. In the recent period, there were marginal improvements in starting college for Black men, but these improvements were not seen for other transitions, such as graduating from college. Overall, Black men with low household income were the least likely group to obtain a college degree. Our results highlight persistent educational inequalities in the US and identify when, and for whom, interventions may target specific barriers to college completion. We argue that in addition to targeted interventions, multisectoral action is needed to dismantle structural barriers in the education and other systems.

        "abstract": "Cities worldwide have turned to publishing strategies that articulate their plans for the future to their peers and stakeholders. How do a city’s interlinkages influence whether and when cities publish such a plan? Informed by political economy and institutional perspectives on organizations, we posit that a combination of competitive and cultural pressures influences a city’s adoption of strategic planning. Institutional theory suggests that strategic planning is adopted as a signal of legitimacy, particularly by entities enmeshed in global culture. Conversely, political economy perspectives hold that strategic planning is vital for competing for international capital and maintaining one’s economic status. Although both a city’s cultural embeddedness and economic status may increase its propensity to strategize, these influences arguably operate through and are shaped by its administration’s centrality in an emerging network of intercity associations. To show this, we tracked the adoption of strategic plans across the 360 largest cities worldwide from 2000 to 2019, uncovering the influence of cities’ network affiliations on the spread and nature of strategic planning. The event history analysis reveals that institutional factors outweigh the influence of economic status in predicting strategic planning. However, the effect of a city’s administrative centrality in inter-city networks diminishes with its economic status. This indicates that network dynamics propagated by higher-status cities more directly influence lower-status cities. The study sheds light on the impact of inter-city networks on cities’ strategic approaches to challenges like climate change, providing a macro-level foundation for understanding city strategy. It also shows how institutions and the political economy jointly influence cities, integrating two literatures that have long existed concurrently but without much interaction.",

        "abstract": "Humanity faces a complex and dangerous global risk landscape, and many different terms and concepts have been used to make sense of it. One broad strand of research characterises how risk emerges from the complex global system, using concepts like systemic risk, Anthropocene risk, synchronous failure, negative social tipping points, and polycrisis. Another strand focuses on possible worst-case outcomes, using concepts like global catastrophic risk (GCR), existential risk, and extinction risk. Despite their clear relevance to each other, only limited connections have been made between these two strands. Here we provide a framework which synthesises the two and shows how emergent properties of the global system contribute to the risk of global catastrophic outcomes. Specifically, the global system generates hazards, amplification, vulnerability, and latent risk, as well as challenges for GCR assessment and mitigation. This systemic lens helps us understand the origins of GCR, provides a useful interface between two deeply related but infrequently connected bodies of work, and provides important insights for risk reduction.",

We illustrate how to use structural causal models to conduct causal inference using regression models based on simulated data of a hypothetical structural causal model of Open Science.

        "abstract": "Genetic and archaeological evidence imply a second major movement of Neanderthals from Western to Central and Eastern Eurasia sometime in the Late Pleistocene. The genetic data suggest a date of 120-80ka for the dispersal and the archaeological record provides an earliest date of arrival in the Altai by ca. 60ka. Because the number of archaeological sites linking the two regions is very small, the exact route taken and its timing have been the matter of considerable debate. In particular, climate change in this period modified landscapes considerably, changing the cost of moving in different directions. Here, we apply agent-based least-cost path simulations for the first time to Neanderthals, showing that they most likely took a northern route through the Urals and southern Siberia under all climate scenarios. Agents leaving either the southern or the northern Caucasus Mountains reach the Altai in less than 2000 years during two time windows when the climate was mild, MIS 5e (the last Interglacial) and in MIS 3. The latter coincides with the dated presence of Neanderthals at Chagyrskaya and Okladnikov Caves in the Altai. The results of this modeling approach demonstrate a remarkable east-west geographic connectivity of northern Eurasia via river corridors despite the presumed barriers of the Ural Mountains and major north-south flowing rivers. Our results highlight the unique strengths of agent-based simulations to reconstruct pathways for ancient migrations.",

        "abstract": "This essay provides an overview of statistical methods in public policy, focused primarily on the United States. I trace the historical development of quantitative approaches in policy research, from early ad hoc applications through the 19th and early 20th centuries, to the full institutionalization of statistical analysis in federal, state, local, and nonprofit agencies by the late 20th century. I then outline three core methodological approaches to policy-centered statistical research across social science disciplines: description, explanation, and prediction, framing each in terms of the focus of the analysis. In descriptive work, researchers explore *what exists* and examine any variable of interest to understand their different distributions and relationships. In explanatory work, researchers ask *why does it exist* and *how can it be influenced*. The focus of the analysis is on explanatory variables (X) to either (1) accurately estimate their relationship with an outcome variable (Y), or (2) causally attribute the effect of specific explanatory variables on outcomes. In predictive work, researchers as *what will happen next* and focus on the outcome variable (Y) and on generating accurate forecasts, classifications, and predictions from new data. For each approach, I examine key techniques, their applications in policy contexts, and important methodological considerations. I then consider critical perspectives on quantitative policy analysis framed around issues related to a three-part \"data imperative\" where governments are driven to count, gather, and learn from data. Each of these imperatives entail substantial issues related to privacy, accountability, democratic participation, and epistemic inequalities—issues at odds with public sector values of transparency and openness. I conclude by identifying some emerging trends in public sector-focused data science, inclusive ethical guidelines, open research practices, and future directions for the field.",

The research looks into the algorithmic work of social media — specifically, how algorithms of social media curate, filter and prioritize a content based upon user data.

This study offers comprehensive empirical insights by analyzing 1,528 urban innovation cases from 2012 to 2022, utilizing the Guangzhou International Award for Urban Innovation (GIAUI) database through topic modeling and case study methods. The result shows that urban innovation practices cover 38 topics across 4 fields, with key focuses on social governance, urban planning, environmental management, and smart cities. Innovation priorities vary by development stage, with higher-HDI (Human Development Index) regions emphasizing smart cities, medium-HDI regions focusing on social inclusion, and lower-HDI regions prioritizing infrastructure and public health. Notably, granular analysis of cases from lower level HDI levels reveals the Global South's immense potential for holistic, socially attuned innovations firmly embedded in local contexts. These innovations demonstrate pathways to sustainability that are both resource-efficient and culturally responsive, offering pragmatic solutions without demanding radical lifestyle changes or hefty investment. The study highlights the entire global community of cities' shared stakes and roles in spreading sustainable urban innovation.",

        "abstract": "Since claims about a ‘replication crisis’ started to circulate, the concept and practice of replication have gained new momentum. Some communities have started to promote replication indiscriminately as a practice and criterion for research quality irrespective of the diverse research communities’ various conditions and ways of knowledge production. Others have identified a replication drive, which involves moving replication into various research communities. This drive is enacted by incentivizing or demanding replication and related Open Science practices, and forms part of a culture change strategy towards increased replicability. Here, we propose the two-dimensional social replication of replication framework. It describes the process of moving replication across epistemic communities and enables us to understand first how the diverse epistemic communities across the research landscape relate to replication as a concept, practice and evaluative criterion and, second, which changes it undergoes along the way. The framework’s two dimensions are adaptation and adoption. Moving replication into different research communities without sufficient adaptation may lead to a potentially problematic and inappropriate social replication of replication. We thus argue that sustainable and appropriate social replication of replication requires adaptation, or more precisely a process of co-adaptation between replication and a community’s already established technologies of accountability.",

        "abstract": "Understanding human behaviour requires simultaneous consideration of “nature and nurture”, yet biocultural enquiry within anthropology remains uncommon. In part, this may stem from historical divisions the between sub-disciplines of anthropology where biological anthropology has specialised in quantitative methods and socio-cultural anthropology in qualitative ones, often leading to siloed approaches and hindering biocultural collaborations. The study of human behaviour within evolutionary anthropology has emerged from a robust methodological tradition of naturalistic observations, mirroring participant observations commonly deployed in socio-cultural research. This offers opportunities for evolutionary anthropologist to go “beyond the quantitative” to facilitate biocultural investigations. However, perhaps due to increasing challenges and impracticalities with observing participants across private spaces, this method has declined in popularity over the last 50 years. Following recent emerging interest in biocultural mechanisms and methodological diversification within evolutionary anthropology, we explore and reflect on autophotography (a visual qualitative method where participants showcase their lives through photographs) as a quasi-naturalistic method. In doing so, we demonstrate how integrating creative methods into evolutionary anthropology may help bridge methodological divides and enhance biocultural enquiry.",

        "abstract": "The litter-raking stands of Bela Krajina in Slovenia are taken as a reference point to examine the entanglements of human and more-than-human worlds through the concept of work as an activity that places humans in a relationship with other living beings. In the domestic agricultural economy of the past, the litter-raking stands were used as pastures for livestock in the spring and summer. In the fall, people gathered litter and cut bracken for bedding the livestock that returned to the barns before winter. The practice led to soil degradation and acidification, so that only sparsely growing birch, pine, and undergrowth of bracken, spring heath, and common heather grew on these lands. In the process of modernization and de-agrarization these activities have been abandoned since the 1960s, and the most litter-raking stands have since become overgrown. Today, some of these stands are protected as natural heritage under Natura 2000. They are home to various birds, butterflies, insects, fungi and orchids and are cut only to preserve biotic diversity. Fast reforestation in this context thus points to the importance of moderate human disturbances for biodiversity conservation. Based on a case study of litter-raking stands, this paper acknowledges the ethic of care as inherent to work as a life-sustaining practice where human and non-human well-being are entangled (Krzywoszynska 2020). Furthermore, it explores whether it is possible to consider work as a life-sustaining practice embedded in a more-than-human relationality, reciprocity, and care that recognizes “work of nature” (Battistoni 2017) for ecosystem maintenance as well.",

Bridging this gap requires intentional knowledge translation strategies that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and real-world application of research findings. Hackathons, which bring together diverse stakeholders in a time-bound, solution-oriented format, offer an approach to addressing this challenge. In January 2025, the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC-GIDA) and the Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA) at the University of Nairobi organized the Bridging the Gap Hackathon (BTGH), designed to strengthen collaboration between academia, policy, and public health practitioners in Kenya. The hackathon convened researchers, software engineers, and policymakers to co-develop data-driven tools tackling public health challenges identified by Kenya's Ministry of Health and the Directorate of Veterinary Services. Over five days and using a structured multi-stage process, six interdisciplinary teams developed prototype solutions to improve outbreak surveillance, vaccine deployment, data quality monitoring, and health workforce estimation. This paper reflects on the hackathon’s structure, participant experiences, and project outcomes, highlighting key lessons for future knowledge translation initiatives. Our findings suggest that hackathons can serve as effective platforms for accelerating interdisciplinary research impact, fostering engagement between policymakers and researchers, and promoting the development of public health solutions.",

It was the first country to diplomatically recognize China in the region and continues to maintain a close diplomatic and economic relationship with China. Chinese territorial claims over the potentially resource-rich South China Sea waters and its islands have caused great unrest among the littoral countries, especially Vietnam and the Philippines. The problem is compounded by the multitude of claims made by these same countries over each other’s territory. The parties to this dispute, with the exception of China, happen to be members of ASEAN. Chinese claims, based on their own interpretation of historical and jurisdictional evidences; challenge the territorial integrity of these states. Malaysia, as one of the founding members of ASEAN and one of the largest economies in the region, wields significant influence over her fellow members-states and could have emerged as a crucial mediator and peacekeeper between the China and the South East Asian countries. However, Malaysia has adopted a cautious approach in dealing with the South China Sea issue, refraining from openly condemning Chinese actions and lodging protests only when her own territorial integrity is repeatedly challenged. Such caution has ensured Malaysia bountiful trade with China, along with cordial diplomatic and even military relations which have brought the two countries very close. However, recent events of Chinese aggression have led Malaysian leaders and the public to question their country’s stance. Ethnic Malays bear grudges for the ethnic Chinese minority in Malaysia, considered disproportionately rich. Malaysian government will also be fearful of Chinese incursions in their territories which are rich in petroleum resources. It can therefore be assumed that although Malaysia will tolerate Chinese actions for reasons of trade and security, she will not abandon the other ASEAN states and openly side with China. Malaysia’s policy in the South China Sea issue had been and in all probability, will continue to be one of diplomatic tightrope walking.",

        "abstract": "To address complex societal challenges, governments increasingly need to make evidence-based decisions and require the best available data as input. As much of relevant data is now in the hands of the private sector, governments increasingly resort to purchasing data from private sources. There is, however, scant empirical evidence and a lack of understanding of how governments go about data purchasing. Therefore, we develop a new conceptual-analytical framework to analyze three models of data purchasing by governments: purchasing raw or aggregated data, data analyses, and data-based services. Next, based on Dutch data purchases, we explore the utility of our framework and create an evidence base detailing what data, data analyses, and data-based services Dutch governments purchase from whom, how, and for what purposes in the context of societal challenges. Our results map buyers and sellers of data in the Dutch context, as well as the types of data sold and in which policy domains. We expose a serious lack of transparency in government reporting on data purchasing. We further discuss our results in view of possible archetypes of data purchases and what purchasing strategy implications they have. Lastly, we propose several recommendations to practitioners and a research agenda for academics.",
