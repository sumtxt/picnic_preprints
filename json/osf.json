        "abstract": "Are policies that contribute to reducing climate vulnerability electorally advantageous? Political science has long studied the politics of carbon dioxide mitigation, but we know less about the political logic of climate impacts. As adaptation lies at the intersection of environmental, social, and disaster policy, its electoral effects are puzzling from a theoretical perspective. We address this gap by studying a program to improve the ability of households to withstand episodes of water scarcity in Mexico City, implemented between presidential cycles. In contrast to conventional forms of social policy, this intervention prioritizes building future resilience instead of immediate material benefits. We take advantage of the means-tested nature of the program to reduce imbalances between treated and control neighbors and estimate a difference-in-differences to evaluate its impact on electoral outcomes. We find that neighborhoods receiving this adaptation policy had, on average, higher levels of support for the party in charge of its implementation at the presidential and gubernatorial levels, compared to similar neighborhoods that did not receive the program. We also posit that reductions in reliance on inadequate water sources are a mechanism that explains this result. Our findings suggest that climate adaptation may be less contentious than mitigation, therefore giving politicians strong incentives to implement them. Moreover, we contribute to the climate politics literature by providing a theoretical framework to understand the political logic of adaptation action, regardless of its specific form or domain.",

        "abstract": "Some people find politics immensely interesting, while others do not. This paper proposes that political interest can in part be explained by the meaning that people find in politics. Evidence from six experiments (n=5,767) shows that appealing to meaning can increase political interest. In these studies, treated participants provide information about what they find meaningful in their lives, with their responses leveraged in on-the-fly treatments that connect their responses to politics. These treatments lead people otherwise disinterested in politics and policy to become more interested in both. The effects of meaning on interest are sizable, equivalent to 43.1% of the pre-treatment divide in political interest between strong and non-strong partisans and 61.1% of the divide between those with and without college degrees. These results offer a new way of understanding---and increasing---political interest.",

        "abstract": "This article examines the infrastructuring of the European Union’s Entry/Exit System (EES) at the juxtaposed border controls of the United Kingdom and France. Drawing on expert interviews, industry conferences, and fieldwork conducted at the ports of Dover, Calais, and the Eurotunnel terminals, it traces the detours EES has taken on its journey from imaginary to implementation in response to material, political, and technical challenges. Requirements for the system such as capturing fingerprints to fulfil eu-LISA's interoperability objectives and enrolling biometrics within ‘line of sight’ of a European border guard have created thorny problems at the Channel ports where travellers arrive to the border in vehicles rather than on foot. Solving these problems has necessitated hard infrastructures and political compromises which have provided opportunities for other actors to influence the sociodigital future of EES through infrastructuring their preferred solutions. The fact that what EES is and will be has changed substantially before it has even entered into operation, shows the moment of suspension, between when work on a system starts and before it is complete, to be a decisive one for materially intervening in sociodigitial futures in the making.",

        "abstract": "Metropolitan areas in the United States are undergoing rapid diversification, significantly reshaping the demographics of local leadership. This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

        "authors": "Selçuk Bedük, Anna Yong",
        "created": "2025-08-25",
        "abstract": "While any experience of child poverty can affect life chances, longer exposure is particularly concerning due to its lasting effects on education, health and earnings. This study adopts a life-course perspective, tracking poverty from birth to age 10 for cohorts born in Britain between 1991 and 2017. On average, 17% of children spent at least half of their childhood in poverty. Long-term poverty affected 25% of those born in the early 1990s, markedly declined to 13-14% for cohorts born after the 1997 welfare reforms, and substantially increased again to 23% for children born following the 2013 austerity reforms. Decomposition analysis shows that cross-cohort changes are driven more by shifts in the penalties associated with work and family risk factors than by changes in their prevalence. These shifts in penalties reflect broader changes in redistribution and predistribution. The early decline in long-term poverty was largely due to rising employment and earnings in low-income households, while the post-austerity increase stems mainly from reduced redistribution. For cohorts born in the 2000s, social transfers played a substantial role in containing long-term poverty despite worsening predistribution. Overall, the findings show that long-term childhood poverty remains a significant challenge in Britain and highlight the need for both stronger redistribution and improved predistribution to address it.",

        "abstract": "Historical travel warnings and advisories offer a record of how governments perceive and communicate country-specific risks over time, yet large-scale quantitative analyses have been rare due to missing, fragmented, and frequently overwritten web data. We present TRAVELWARN-Crawler, an open pipeline that collects, recovers, cleans, stores, and standardizes advisories and warnings from archived web sources. Using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and issuer-specific Scrapy spiders, we reconstruct up to three decades of timelines for the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. The data can be used to support comparative research in political communication, international relations, and tourism studies. Descriptively, the UK issues more country pages and updates than the US and Australia. Cross-issuer agreement about severity is modest with the highest pairwise level agreement for US–Australia (∼49%). These results indicate substantial heterogeneity in how close allies communicate travel risk and underscore the value of reproducible, textual data beyond numeric severity levels alone.",

        "abstract": "Social scientists have developed dozens of measures for assessing partisan bias in redistricting. But these measures are not easily adapted to other groups, including groups defined by race, class, or geography. Nor are they applicable to single- or no-party contexts, such as local redistricting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework of harm for evaluating the impacts of a districting plan on individual voters and the groups to which they belong. We consider a voter harmed if their chosen candidate is not elected under the current plan, but would be under a different plan. Harm improves on existing measures by both focusing on the choices of individual voters and directly incorporating counterfactual plans. We discuss strategies for estimating harm, and demonstrate the utility of our framework through analyses of partisan gerrymandering in New Jersey, voting rights litigation in Alabama, and racial dynamics of Boston City Council elections.",

        "abstract": "U.S. higher education operates as a mechanism of economic control, organized around the dynamics of replacement, credential inflation, and indenture. This paper revisits and updates the 2000 “Indentured Replacement Theory of Credential Inflation” that first argued this case, adding a 2024 lens on endowment capture. A descriptive synthesis of public data series reveals the scale of this control: student-loan balances stand at roughly $1.64 trillion with 90+ day delinquency near 10.2% (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2025); meanwhile, institutional endowments total $873.7 billion with $30 billion in annual spending (NACUBO/Commonfund, 2025). Evidence on “degree reset” is mixed, and post-pause repayment frictions elevate delinquency risk. Policy developments in 2023–2025 increase scrutiny of institutional finances while providing limited direct borrower relief. The paper concludes by proposing structural, cultural, and market-facing remedies, evaluated by a simple test: does a given policy loosen—or tighten—the binding effects of debt on life chances?",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the challenges and strategies of agricultural e-commerce platforms in enhancing digital visibility, with a focus on the case of Nông Sản Bán Buôn in Vietnam. Using a case study approach, the research highlights how early adoption of search engine optimization (SEO) enabled rapid growth, but also how structural vulnerabilities, shifting digital algorithms, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted platform stability. The findings show that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture face unique barriers to sustaining online presence, including limited resources, technological dependence, and competitive asymmetries compared to larger players. By situating these experiences within broader academic debates on digital marketing, platform economies, and rural development, the study contributes to understanding the systemic inequalities embedded in digital commerce. The paper concludes with practical recommendations for SMEs to diversify marketing strategies, balance SEO with multi-channel engagement, and strengthen resilience in rapidly changing digital environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a practitioner-led case study of Nông Sản Bán Buôn, a small agricultural e-commerce platform in Vietnam that aimed to connect rural producers to international markets. Unlike most research on digital trade which focuses on large platforms or macroeconomic policy, this study examines the practical barriers facing small, mission-driven ventures operating under resource constraints. Drawing on firsthand experience and qualitative documentation from 2017 to 2024, the paper identifies six core challenges: digital visibility, buyer trust, regulatory compliance, logistics infrastructure, access to capital, and pandemic-induced market shocks. The findings illustrate that technical innovation alone is insufficient for sustainability in emerging market contexts. Long-term success in agri-tech requires trust-building, inclusive infrastructure, and ecosystem-level coordination. This study contributes grounded insights to the literature on agricultural digital transformation and highlights policy directions to support small platforms in the Global South.",

        "authors": "martina mchenga",
        "created": "2025-08-27",
        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: Corporal punishment by teachers remains one of the most pervasive forms of school-based violence in sub-Saharan Africa, undermining adolescent wellbeing and educational attainment despite statutory prohibitions. While most research has focused on prevalence, teacher behaviours, or household risk factors, little is known about how adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative environments shape their vulnerability to teacher violence. Methods: This study analysed nationally representative Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) from five countries: Eswatini (2021), Mozambique (2019), Kenya (2019), Namibia (2019), and Lesotho (2018), focusing on 10,904 school-going adolescents aged 13-17 years. Logistic regression models estimated associations between individual endorsement of corporal punishment, peer-level attitudes (measured using leave-one-out peer endorsement), and reported experience of teacher violence. Results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Findings: show that 13.6% of adolescents reported teacher corporal punishment in the past year. More than half (52.8%) endorsed corporal punishment, with peer endorsement averaging 53%. Adolescents who endorsed corporal punishment had twice the odds of experiencing teacher violence (aOR=2.1, 95% CI:1.6-2.7). Each 10-percentage-point increase in peer endorsement was associated with a 10% increase in odds (aOR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Gender moderated these associations: while boys were generally more exposed, girls who endorsed corporal punishment in pro-corporal peer contexts faced sharply elevated risks. Associations varied across countries, with the strongest effects in Kenya. Conclusion: The findings highlight adolescents and peers as overlooked but critical drivers of school violence. Prevention strategies must therefore extend beyond legal bans and teacher training to also shift adolescent attitudes, peer climates, and home–school linkages. Evidence from interventions such as the Good School Toolkit (Uganda), Green Dot bystander program (U.S.), and SASA! (Uganda) demonstrates that norms change is possible. Adapting such models to address corporal punishment could provide a sustainable pathway to safer schools across Africa.",

        "abstract": "Many countries develop through the increase of their economic resources, which naturally exist in most countries. On the other hand, some evidence shows that countries can develop through fiscal decentralisation, which promotes this growth through regional growth via significantly viable economic transformation. In Africa, for example, federalist countries such as Nigeria and South Africa show greater capacity for regional transformation through indicators of great relevance in themselves. Evidence also shows, for example, greater economic transformation through fiscal federalism. South Africa, for example, has less significant decentralisation but greater capacity to collect tax revenues. The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties. Although there is de facto fiscal decentralisation, particularly in Nigeria and Ethiopia, there is nevertheless a greater lack of economic development in all territories, with the exception, for example, of states with greater economic concentration such as Lagos and Abuja.",

This study examines student perceptions at a private high school that implemented a zero-access phone ban during the 2024–2025 school year. Two anonymous surveys were fielded at policy launch (October 2024) and three months later (January 2025), yielding a combined N = 494. Primary outcomes were perceived changes in in-person interaction frequency and quality, perceived connectedness, perceived classroom focus, perceived productivity during school, and self-reported academic performance. Most respondents perceived social benefits, including more frequent face-to-face conversations, while a minority reported diminished connectedness. Nearly half perceived higher productivity during school, yet most perceived no change in academic performance. Over half reported increased phone use during homework, which may offset in-school gains. Findings underscore heterogeneity in responses and suggest that bans, without complementary supports, can improve opportunities for in-person interaction for many students but may disadvantage students who rely on digital scaffolds for social engagement.",

        "abstract": "In many Western countries, children with foreign-born parents are lagging behind children with native-born parents in school performance. In the policy debate much hope is placed on the potential of pre-schools to remedy this, by providing a learning and language environment that can compensate for the disadvantages that these children face. We study inequalities in pre-school learning contexts by immigrant origin, using full population register data that matches all children to their families and pre-schools. Enrolment in pre-school is lower for children of immigrants, but this is – surprisingly – almost entirely driven by low enrolment of children in non-refugee families. Contrary to expectations, children from origin groups with larger school difficulties have high pre-school enrolment rates. Our results suggest that explanations for low enrolment should primarily be sought in intentions to remain long-term in the host country. In pre-schools, immigrant background children have a somewhat higher teacher density, but a somewhat lower density of qualified teachers, and a somewhat higher turnover rate and sickness absence among teachers. These differences are however small. Where we see large differences is in the composition of the child and teacher group: Immigrant-background children go to pre-schools where a much higher proportion of teachers and children have immigrant background. We conclude that hopes to equalize school outcomes through encouraging pre-school enrolment are misplaced, and equalizing structural indicators is unlikely to make a big difference. The compensatory potential of pre-schools lies primarily in a de-segregation of staff and children across pre-schools.",

These results provide the first extensive list of identities ranked by their survivability within individuals’ self-presentations.

        "abstract": "Rap music, often scrutinized for its portrayal of violence, misogyny, materialism, and drug use, can serve as a compelling case study for empirically exploring how art reflects its time. While existing literature has documented a purported increasing trend of these themes, investigations that consider the social conditions during song production remain scarce. By analyzing 26,438 rap singles released in the United States from 1990 to 2015, we find that the prevalence of these lyrical themes does not show a consistent upward trajectory. Instead, they exhibit significant temporal fluctuations, with each following a distinct pattern. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong contemporaneous correlation between these lyrical fluctuations and their corresponding national social indicators, including rates for crime, sexual assault, poverty, and DEA arrests. Crucially, this correlation becomes significantly stronger when using social statistics specific to Black Americans. These findings provide large-scale empirical evidence that art is a sensitive reflection of the social and economic realities of the time, offering insights into how deep-seated social problems are depicted through artistic expression.",

Building on comparative welfare state research and inspired by research on stratified reproduction, we examine regulatory provisions towards abortion, contraception and medically assisted reproduction, empirically mapping the institutional landscape for 30 countries between 1995 and 2020. We propose a conceptual framework of ‘reproductive equity support’, defined as the sum of statutory permitted and resourced reproductive options, which varies across four ideal types: conservative, paternalistic, libertarian and comprehensive. Second, we operationalize permissiveness and generosity for contraception, abortion and medically assisted reproduction using policy indicators from the novel International Reproduction Policy Database. We find strong variation between countries, and substantive shifts over time: while most countries make a leap towards more permissive reproduction policy, increase in generosity is less pronounced and less wide-spread.",

However, women in agriculture have commonly been excluded from influencing and accessing these digital tools. Rigorous evaluations have found that including women farmers in the creation and screening of farming videos can benefit women through improved productivity and decision-making power. But what is needed for extension workers to make these videos accessible to women farmers outside of carefully managed pilots? We implemented a randomized controlled trial testing how the gender of farmers featured in wheat farming advisory videos influenced how much, and with whom, 294 extension workers shared these videos in rural Bihar. We interpreted results through twenty follow-up interviews and the ‘Mechanisms and Conditions’ framework based in affordance theory. We found the extent to which extension workers shared videos with women farmers hinged on extension workers' perceptions, material resources, and cultural contexts, rather than the gender of farmers featured in videos. From a theoretical perspective, this core finding suggests the 'Mechanisms and Conditions' framework requires modification to account for material resource access when explaining technology use. From a practical perspective, the core finding prompts practitioners to ask ‘how might extension systems circulating digital tools be more inclusive?’, not just ‘how might we adapt digital tools to be more inclusive?’. This systems-level approach to empowering women in agricultural innovation systems could involve supporting inclusive person-to-person extension networks, and avoiding dependence on smartphone-based extension systems, like YouTube and chatbots.",

While Johnson et al. highlight four key principles—harm prevention, public interest, paternalism, and the duty of easy rescue—the present analysis contends that these ethical frameworks are insufficient unless safety, efficacy, proportionality, and necessity of the intervention are established beforehand. Drawing on examples from COVID-19 policies, including social distancing, surveillance measures, and vaccine mandates, the article demonstrates how weak or uncertain empirical evidence undermined ethical justifications for coercion. Cases such as low efficacy against transmission, underappreciated adverse events, and proportionality concerns reveal the dangers of treating empirical validity as an afterthought. The article concludes that coercive public health policies cannot be ethically defensible without robust prior evidence of effectiveness and safety. Ethical reasoning must therefore be grounded in empirical reality, with context-sensitive, localized approaches that ensure transparency, autonomy, and trust.",

Digital sociologists have warned of “filter bubbles,” attributed to shifts in the way culture is accessed online, and of persisting digital inequalities, while sociologists of culture have shown that diversity in consumption is valued as a marker of upper-middle-class status. Few empirical studies have connected these findings. We estimate the effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption using survey data from France. We apply template matching to adjust for six sets of confounders. We find a significant, positive effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption, measured by the number of cultural genres declared to be consumed, across three domains (music, movies, and TV shows) as well as on cosmopolitanism, measured by the propensity to watch movies and TV shows in a foreign language. The magnitude of this effect is relatively low for music(0.1 sd, 0.2 genres), intermediate for movies (0.2 sd, 0.6 genres), but high for TV shows (0.46 sd, 1.2 genres). The study brings new evidence against the filter bubble thesis; it shows that platforms do reinforce cultural inequalities by increasing the gap in consumption diversity between the working classes and the elite. It further suggests that the effect of technology on cultural consumption might be mainly mediated through its impact on cultural markets rather than changes in cultural experience.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the archetypal figures of Sköll and Hati, the mythic wolves of Norse cosmology, as embodiments of cosmic shadow, destruction, and renewal within Jungian analytical psychology. Rooted in Viking-era Germanic myth and anchored in Danish cultural artifacts such as the Trundholm Sun Chariot and Nordic winter rituals, the study explores how these wolves symbolize the cyclical tension between psychic dissolution and rebirth. Drawing on primary Jungian concepts alongside contemporary psychoanalytic and mythopoetic scholarship, the analysis positions Sköll and Hati as necessary forces that disrupt egoic sovereignty and reveal the shadow aspect of time and consciousness. The wolves’ pursuit and devouring of the sun and moon reflect psychic upheavals commonly experienced during midlife crises, cultural collapse, and spiritual transformation. The archetypes discussed here do not represent pathology or nihilism but serve as initiatory figures that require surrender to chaos for psychological growth. The integration of Nordic cultural context deepens the understanding of these archetypes and provides a unique contribution to the field of archetypal psychology. This paper encourages clinicians and scholars to consider the paradox of destruction and renewal inherent in the archetypal shadow, thus advancing the discourse on collective and individual processes of transformation.",

After validating this question-level measure, we next demonstrate that a call-level curveball measure predicts absolute returns, absolute abnormal returns, and changes in a firm’s average analyst rating. Finally, we identify the types of analysts who are most likely to pose curveball questions, the types of firms that are most likely to receive them, and the conditions under which they tend to arise.",

Our first question was to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services at different income levels. Based on our newly introduced compensation ratio measure, we showed that the combination of child contingent benefits and out-of-pocket costs tends to be low-income targeted, in the sense that lower-income families pay lower fees for childcare and/or receive higher benefits. In Poland and Sweden, the out-of-pocket expenses for childcare tended to be lower (on average) across the income distribution than child-contingent benefits, whereas high-income families in Belgium and Spain paid more for childcare than they received as financial support. Secondly, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services for different family types. Here, we found that generally (with the exception of Spain) families with more children receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to families with fewer children. In all the four countries studied here, single-parent families receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to two-parent families. Finally, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services when families transition into work. Here, we found that, generally, the compensation ratio was higher for families on social assistance or employment at low wages, compared to families working at higher wages. This holds for single-parent families (with the exception of Poland) as well as two-parent families. Moreover, the extent to which the compensation rate was lowered with employment and at higher wage levels differed between countries, with the drop particularly notable in Belgium and moderate to absent in Poland. For average wage employees, the compensation ratio was lowest in Belgium compared to the other countries included here.",

This study employed a data-driven, multistage analytical approach using data from the Next Steps cohort - a longitudinal study tracking young people born in England between 1989 and 1990 - to identify potential socio-economic, environmental, and attitudinal factors associated with locus of control at age 20. In addition to confirming well-established variables such as sex, family environment, and socio-economic background, the analysis identified several additional potential antecedents, including academic and career aspirations, perceived financial security, national identity, participation in structured activities, and avoidance of addictive behaviors. By utilizing large-scale, nationally representative longitudinal data, this study enhances understanding of the antecedents of locus of control.

Our findings reveal that while interviewees occasionally struggle with feelings of meaninglessness, precisely their disbelief in ultimate meaning provides them with a sense of freedom, relief, and acceptance. The mechanism behind this is irony, constituting a mode of consciousness that paradoxically and playfully acknowledges the contingencies and uncertainties of existence. This ironic mode of consciousness, we conclude, does not only provide meaning to a perceived meaningless life, but leads those religious nones to socially distinguish themselves from (religious) people who do believe that life has an intrinsic meaning.",

We apply a multi-group Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to examine how employment prevalences and premiums contribute to poverty differences across varying family-types. Our results suggest that differences in employment prevalences contribute minimally to poverty gaps, while premium effects drive most observable effects. Part-time employment shows even weaker poverty reduction effects across all family types. Sensitivity analysis reveals vulnerability to unmeasured confounding, suggesting true causal effects may be smaller still. In sum, employment is not a panacea for poverty reduction across family types.",

Healthcare professionals play a key role in addressing alcohol consumption, yet little is known about older adults’ attitudes towards these conversations. This study aimed to: 1) examine older adults’ attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations with GPs, practice nurses, district nurses and volunteers; and 2) explore associations between these attitudes and older adults’ socio-demographic characteristics and alcohol consumption. Methods: A cross-sectional survey (N = 424) was conducted to collect data on socio-demographics, alcohol consumption and attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between personal characteristics and attitudes. Results: Support for routinely asking about alcohol consumption was highest for GPs (60.4%), followed by practice nurses (55.0%), district nurses (46.7%) and volunteers (17.5%). Older adults aged 75 and older were more likely to view alcohol use as a personal matter and were less likely to initiate conversations with GPs (OR 0.66, CI 0.43–1.00) or district nurses (OR 0.60, CI 0.38–0.94), compared to those younger than 75. High-risk drinkers were more likely to have negative attitudes towards district nurses routinely addressing alcohol consumption (OR 0.54, CI 0.29–0.99). Conclusions: Attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations differ across healthcare professionals, with GPs viewed most favourably and volunteers least. These findings highlight the need for healthcare systems to avoid treating healthcare professionals as interchangeable when addressing alcohol consumption.",

        "abstract": "The core objective of this paper is to investigate and propose methods and means through which various classes of innovative and creative thinking techniques which include both existing techniques in popular current usage, and those yet to be conceptualized and theorized can be baked into scientific method both integrally and intrinsically, and in a natural and a harmonious fashion. This we believe can lead to faster and more comprehensive scientific progress across disciplines and geographies and usher in a new era of scientific research by increasing the rate of scientific output. We begin this paper by carrying out a brief overview of the key concepts of scientific method, its characteristics and its history, and also refer to our previous observations and discussions on scientific method by referencing our previously published works over the years. We also define and propose categories of individuals by whom we believe this approach can be meaningfully adopted and implemented, and also lay bare the purported objectives of this approach. Last but not the least, we review existing approaches to innovative and creative techniques, and drive home a very crucial and a critical point: the entire field of creative and innovative techniques is apparently in its infancy yet, and more innovative and creative techniques need to be conceptualized and gestated in the years and decades to come including those specific to scientific theorization.",

        "abstract": "What does it mean when individuals report having a wide variety of cultural knowledge and taste? Core contemporary theories propose different answers to this question, suggesting that cultural breadth is either rooted in the development of “passing knowledge” across multiple domains, or the expression of more general “dispositional openness” to a wide variety of culture. To adjudicate between these two perspectives I introduce the use of pseudo items into culture research, and integrate their usage with Bourdieu’s observations about “competence” and the “right to speak.” I find evidence for a dispositional openness account to claimed cultural knowledge, in addition to a known gender effect that is likely also rooted in dispositions. In closing I discuss how my findings may be suggestive of a new form of allodoxia for elites. I also discuss how pseudo items and other productively weird methodological tools can help refine our analyses of longstanding culture questions, while also generating new ones.",

        "abstract": "Nonstandard work schedules (NSWS) among mothers have been linked to negative outcomes in children, yet less research studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this association. To date no research has explored the mechanisms that directly influence children’s cognitive and social-emotional development. Using data from the UK-based Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), we examine the relationship between maternal work schedules and children’s social-emotional development from ages three to seven, focusing on three potential mediators: the stability of children’s daily routines, the types of their daily activities, and maternal depression. We find that maternal NSWS is associated with increased social-emotional difficulties in children, particularly when mothers work at night. Among the three mechanisms, maternal depression emerges as the most significant mediator, followed by regular bedtime routines. These findings suggest that while daily routines and activities are important for child development, a substantial portion of the impact of maternal NSWS is mediated through maternal psychological well-being. Effective interventions to support children’s social-emotional development should consider the mental health and well-being of mothers working nonstandard hours.",

        "abstract": "The study of segregation in activity spaces is experiencing renewed attention, fueled by the increasing availability of mobility data from mobile phones and social media. These new data sources allow for high-resolution analysis of how people move through cities and interact across diverse neighborhoods. A key goal behind this work is to inform the design of inclusive spaces that foster intergroup contact and social cohesion. However, much of this research has focused on statistical diversity (typically measured through census data, mobility traces, or indices that capture the distribution and co-presence of social groups) while giving less consideration to how diversity is perceived by those who use these spaces. This study bridges that gap by combining GIS-based mobility modeling with on-street survey data. Using aggregated mobility data from ~90,000 mobile phone users in Auckland, New Zealand, we estimated ethnic mobility flows and computed spatial diversity indices for residents and visitors across six neighborhoods. In parallel, we conducted 249 on-street surveys in those neighborhoods to capture perceptions of diversity. Our findings reveal only a weak correlation between statistical and perceived diversity, highlighting that individuals do not simply mirror demographic compositions in their perceptions. Instead, perceived diversity is more strongly predicted by self-reported intergroup contact (both within the specific neighborhood and across the city) and by affective factors such as space affinity and attitudes toward outgroup members. These results underscore the importance of integrating both statistical and perceptual data to understand diversity in urban environments. Designing for inclusion, we argue, must account for both who is present in a space and how that space is experienced.",

        "abstract": "Over the last ten years, the broad field examining information disorder has generated a plethora of research by leveraging the strengths of its interdisciplinary nature. However, interdisciplinary fields also experience challenges including competing and incompatible theoretical orientations. This study uses two dominant orientations in the field that take technological (i.e., Shannon-Weaver model) or social (i.e., pragmatics) approaches to deception as guiding theories to inform theoretical codes for a deductive qualitative analysis and pattern matching approach. The thematic codes are applied to a systematic interdisciplinary sample of information disorder studies articles from 2010-2021 identified by Broda and Strömbäck’s meta-synthesis. The findings indicate that a significant proportion of the sample is moving towards an integrated consideration of intentional and unintentional deception by including both technological and social components. Specifically, techno-centric approaches are moving towards including contexts of message providers or receivers in their models. These combined approaches that consider both context of individuals and technological components of message transmission do not adhere to either of the theoretical perspectives examined. Future research should formally integrate the competing assumptions in technological and social models of information disorder to better align with the literature. These methods contribute to the assessment and refinement of the dominant approaches to information disorder as well as identifying gaps for future research. Specifically, there are many ways the sample operationalizes each model component. There is not a “correct” way to measure each component but future research is needed to assess if each operationalization is measuring the same construct. Further, there are model components that are underrepresented in the sample (i.e., neurocognitive and eco-temporal context) and should be addressed by future research.",

Leveraging newly mandated transparency data under the European Union’s Digital Services Act, we uncover substantial cross-lingual disparities in moderation workforce allocation across platforms, both in language coverage and the number of moderators relative to the volume of user-generated content in each language. While larger platforms such as YouTube and Meta have moderators in many languages, we find that millions of EU-based users on smaller platforms, including Twitter/X, post in languages without any human oversight. Even when languages have at least one moderator, moderator allocation varies widely and disproportionately to content volume, with Twitter/X mainly prioritizing English while YouTube invests proportionally more in other European languages. Across platforms, languages primarily spoken in the ‘Global South’—such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic—consistently receive proportionally fewer moderators than English, ranging from an average of 55% of English’s allocation on YouTube to only 7.5% on Twitter/X. These findings highlight the need for more meaningful and globally inclusive transparency in platform moderation, to ensure that social media users everywhere receive equitable protection from online harms.",

Two third-party data scrapers on Apify were used to obtain a large sample of TikToks (n=3,506) scraped using contraception-related search terms and hashtags. These videos were screened for eligibility, and we used a hybrid deductive and inductive thematic approach to analyze eligible videos (n=712). A youth advisory committee was formed to guide and interpret the research. Central themes include contrasts between user experiences of side effects and clinical evidence, anti-hormonal sentiment, empowerment, and trust/mistrust in healthcare. This research provides a case study for analyzing TikTok videos to understand emerging population chatter about reproductive health experiences that can be applied to other research topics. Population health researchers can leverage SNS data, building on established qualitative methods, for meaningful and timely insights.",

        "abstract": "The core objective of this paper is to show why academic Marxism, the intellectual arm of Marxism and Marxist thought has hit an intellectual road block, and is staring at a dead end. Our prognosis is that it is barely likely to survive in its present form for another decade or two. We begin this paper by defining what Marxism is and tracing its thought over the past one and a half centuries or so including varieties and regional variants of Marxism and its common criticisms. The success and failures of Marxism and communism are also likewise probed and investigated. The sphere of influence of Marxism is also probed on fields such as art, architecture, archeology, historiography, religious studies, and cultural studies. We also go on to show why Marxist thought is greatly fossilized and steeped in a mid?nineteenth century mindset, and is unlikely to work in different contexts and situations as it has limited validity and applicability. Many of the failures of mainstream Marxism and Marxist thought also overflow and cascade into academic Marxism too, and it is time to reassess all facets and aspects of Marxism from their bootstraps. We also propose and examine alternative approaches to replace various concepts and components of academic Marxism, and link all our concepts with our previously published papers in a seamless, integrated chain. As such we expect this paper to be an integral component of our globalization movement, and it would not be difficult to understand or figure out why.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the creation of Anthropological Pedagogy as a distinct field of study within the framework of Anthropology, interfacing traditional Anthropology and Pedagogy with some pre-defined principles and objectives, chiefly designed to promote Anthropological goals and objectives through the medium of education. This paper proposes to lay the groundwork for what we believe will be an exciting and promising field, and we hope other researchers, scholars, Anthropologists and Pedagogists will take the concepts presented herein to their logical conclusion. This is based on the premise that there can be no quick fixes to complex and seemingly intractable issues, but that the ball must be set in motion nonetheless to replace superannuated axioms. This proposed field of study is distinct from the field of Educational psychology which deals with the psychology of learning, is much broader in scope than ‘Anthropology of Education’, and the relatively less-known field of Pedagogical Anthropology which was created over a century ago by Maria Montessori and others, even though there may be varying levels of overlap between them. This sub-discipline is proposed to be created with the fond hope that by combining the two crucial disciplines of Anthropology and Pedagogy, a new platform will be created for the wholesome furtherance of human welfare and interests, particularly long-term and global welfare through more scientifically structured education systems, which are designed to merge short-term local considerations with long-term global objectives. This approach includes within its ambit topics such as content fixation for societal benefit, long-term societal benefit, individual benefit and maximum psychological impact. Needless to say, it is integrated with the Theory of Mindspace, the Theory of Mind-orientation, Societal orientation and Cultural remediation. It also deals with the collection and analysis of meaningful metrics, consensus-building and mobilization of international opinion for the realization of the goals, and implementation of the principles of Anthropological Pedagogy.",

Using a mixed-methods approach, including structured surveys and qualitative interviews, we explore how the incentive influenced travel behavior, mode substitution, and public transit connectivity. Results indicate that 69% of participants connected to transit, while 50% of these riders would have otherwise used privately paid rideshare and 6% would have used their private vehicle, and another 6% would have walked or cycled. The remaining 38% of participants would have used transit to reach the public transit station. The study offers critical insights for transit agencies and mobility providers aiming to design integrated AV-transit systems that serve the public good. While there is a risk of misallocating funds to individuals already willing and able to pay for rideshare services, these findings underscore that targeted subsidies can yield meaningful reductions in private vehicle use and promote multimodal travel.",

        "abstract": "This paper attempts to merge the concepts and theoretical frameworks of the disciplines of Anthropology and Economics, and attempts to create a new sub-field in Economics called ‘Anthropological Economics’ which is mired in Anthropological concepts and principles and seeks to maximize not only human welfare and happiness but also wealth maximization across cultures, while considering both the psychic unity of man, universal human needs and culture?specific factors. Thus, Anthropological Economics is expected to be inter-related to other disciplines of Economics, but remain complementary to them i.e., it is not expected that it will intrude into other sub-fields of economics, replace them, or override their principles in any way. It will therefore draw upon other aspects of economic theory, and enrich them suitably. It is therefore expected that all aspects of Economic theory will be taken into consideration for policy formulation and decision-making, including those of Anthropological economics, and independent, context-specific judgment will always be applied. The new proposed field of Anthropological Economics proposes to take the idea of Human Welfare to its logical conclusion by extending the work already carried out in various sub-disciplines of economics, and integrating it more tightly with various concepts in Anthropology. Many new tools and techniques are therefore, proposed as a part of this paper, and we believe these will suitably enrich the field of Economics as well. While many attempts have been made in the past to integrate the fields of Anthropology and Economics, we hope this endeavour will take this exercise to a much higher level, by creating a new generation of “Anthroeconomists”. We also hope it will eventually help move mainstream economics away from Neo-classical approaches to Anthropological and human-centric approaches.",

Leveraging modern redistricting software, we simulate millions of alternative Census tract maps that satisfy Census guidelines, compute segregation for each, and recover the full probabilistic distribution of common indices. These simulations yield new estimates of racial segregation across U.S. cities and, crucially, measure the aggregation‑induced variability hidden in conventional estimates. Encouragingly, values calculated with official tract definitions closely track the mean of the simulated distribution, exhibiting only a slight upward bias, and segregation metrics shift modestly across maps—though variability grows in smaller cities. While our findings confirm the practical robustness of Census tracts, our data and software provide a general framework for diagnosing and correcting spatial‑aggregation error in other contexts.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary news and opinion dissemination is characterized not by a fixed set of senders and receivers, but by networked information flows and active curation by multiple types of actors, from professional organizations, politicians and journalists to interest groups, pundits and opinionated individuals. Approaches to analyzing news dissemination on social media need to take stock of the broader information sharing environment that news sharing is part of. This study presents a general approach for analyzing large-scale information flows on social media in a cross-platform context by tracing URLs. Using a selection of alternative news media outlets from Germany, Austria, Sweden and Denmark as a starting point for operationalizing the broader news sharing environment that alternative news content is shared within, this study traces URL sharing across Facebook, Twitter (X), Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram, Vkontakte, Gab and 4Chan in multiple iterations of snowball sampling. A total of ~900 million posts are collected, followed by a two-pronged analysis of 1) general cross-platform flows and platform outflow/inflow dynamics and 2) cross-platform characteristics of networks based on repeated mutual URL sharing among actors. Each part of the analysis considers both URLs that simply appear on multiple platforms as well as those that are shared directly from one platform to another. Results show that one third of all URLs that appear in more than one post are cross-platform, with 17% being shared directly from one platform to another. Modelling mutual URL sharing behavior as a network shows that only 16 – 24% of the network is strictly single platform. Additional specific platform dynamics are presented and discussed in relation to previous findings on cross-platform content sharing.",

We first highlight the diverse and evolving usage of the concept of militarism over time and across different knowledge forms.

        "abstract": "This paper explores the vargr-an Old Norse term connoting both \"wolf\" and \"outlaw\"-as a symbol of social exclusion and psychological projection. In early Scandinavian law, the vargr marked those expelled from society through outlawry, a formal ritual that maintained social cohesion. Drawing from Jungian depth psychology, the vargr can be seen as a scapegoat for the community's shadow-the rejected parts of the self, including rage, shame, and transgression. This mirrors René Girard's theory of scapegoating, where societies manage inner tension by casting blame onto an external figure. The wolf's wild and dangerous image reinforced its role as a symbolic container for threat. Norse sagas and Thing-site archaeology support the vargr's cultural and legal significance. In contemporary psychological terms, the vargr archetype illuminates how modern individuals manage exclusion and disowned identity. Understanding this figure highlights enduring patterns of exile, repression, and healing within both ancient and modern contexts. Keywords: Vargr, Norse mythology, outlawry, Jungian psychology, shadow archetype",

        "abstract": "This paper is the last in our trilogy on Twenty-First Century Historiography. It attempts to bring all our endeavours to their logical culmination and as such may be construed to be our apotheosis in this regard. The first paper proposed a basic approach for Historiography in the Twenty-first Century and laid out the basic objectives of Twenty-first Century Historiography. The second paper laid out the core principles of Twenty-first Century Historiography, and these were seen a necessary adjunct for the accomplishment of the objectives of Twenty-first Century Historiography as defined in the first paper. In this paper, we introduce Anthropological Historiography as an integral, though not core component of Twenty-first Century Historiography and lay down is basic tenets and objectives. We also delineate the role that we expect will be played by Anthropological Historiography in the attainment of long-term Anthropological goals and objectives, and in promoting human welfare and well-being in general. Anthropological Historiography, with its myriad and multiple interfaces with other sciences is also expected to play a major role in promoting a scientific temper among the laity and the general public and trigger shifts in individual and societal orientations in due course by countering popular perceptions on many issues that impact their daily lives and making outdated and popular paradigms and ideologies redundant. We expect that Anthropological Historiography will play a major role in marginalizing fringe movements besides leading to an enhanced understanding of various aspects of science, history and ethnology among the population and ushering in intellectual movements where such movements are long overdue, and very indirectly leading to a quantum increase in scientific endeavours. We also believe that Anthropological Historiography should be taught as a specialized sub-discipline chiefly targeted towards higher grade students, or students pursuing advanced courses, and should be pursued not by general historians, but by specialized Anthropological Historians.",

        "abstract": "For a variety of reasons, including a need to save time and a desire to reduce biases in outcomes, some funders of research have started to use partial randomisation in their funding decision processes. The effect that randomisation interventions have on the reliability of those processes should, it is argued, be a consideration in their use, but this key aspect of their implementation remains under-appreciated. Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations. The simple yet apparently effective specification of the simulation of reviewer scores implemented here may also provide insights into the distribution of merit across research funding proposals, and of assessment of them.",

        "abstract": "With the growing importance of the knowledge economy across Europe and beyond, governments increasingly demand research to deliver tangible economic and societal impact, translating into funding systems incentivizing societally relevant research and leading to an increasing monitoring of societal impact. This commentary pleads for a re-engagement with the ‘geographies of research assessment’. Informed by a dualistic understanding of scale as both fixed and socially constructed, the commentary firstly argues for comparing and contrasting the influence of different national research evaluation systems on geographical knowledge production. Secondly, the contribution conceives of research evaluation systems as a form of scalar politics which enables a view of the actors and networks contesting current evaluation systems and promoting alternatives. The paper concludes that rather than trying to fit the discipline to the system, geographers should instead question which evaluation system would fit the discipline.",

Despite decreasing costs and growing feasibility of multi-gene panels, implementation pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing strategies remains limited across Europe. This study explores the potential impact and barriers to implementation in Italy, combining a review of current evidence with multistage consultations with Italian experts in related fields (pharmacology, laboratory medicine, genetics, clinical care, and public health). Our analysis supports the clinical utility, economic sustainability, and feasibility of pre-emptive PGx testing. However, key barriers persist, including limited real-world data, unclear reimbursement mechanisms, insufficient laboratory and IT infrastructure, poor clinician training, and patient concerns related to privacy and data protection. To address these challenges, we propose strategic actions across six areas: regulatory alignment, research investment, professional training and result interpretation, public awareness and consent, laboratory infrastructure, and IT systems and data governance.",

        "created": "2025-08-27",
        "abstract": "This article develops a semantic-pragmatic analysis methodology for identifying linguistic manipulation strategies in media texts. Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.",

        "abstract": "Elite and Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) philanthropy is widely debated for its social impact, motivations, and consequences - yet much of this discourse relies on assumptions or theoretical critiques that lack a robust empirical base. This scoping review addresses this gap by systematically mapping published empirical research on elite philanthropy to answer a core question: what is actually known, where is evidence strong or weak, and how can future research be better directed? Drawing on 182 empirical studies identified through comprehensive database searches and citation analysis, this review shows that existing research is geographically skewed towards the United States and the United Kingdom. The findings reveal patterns in research themes, theoretical perspectives, and methodological choices - alongside major gaps, including limited studies in non-Western contexts, consequently failing to explore differing cultural and religious dimensions, and highlights the sparsity of empirical support for widely held critical assumptions. By describing what the empirical literature does and does not show, this paper argues for a more globally inclusive, theoretically diverse, and methodologically rigorous research agenda. The review provides scholars and practitioners with an evidence-based foundation to challenge untested claims, develop new theory, and inform more effective philanthropic practice in an era of growing economic inequality and global wealth concentration. The paper calls for more research into topics such as the philanthropy of younger entrepreneurs, gender dynamics, the influence of effective altruism, and recent global phenomena - including the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and technological innovation.",

With the pervasive rise and shift from traditional information systems to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based intelligent information systems, however, the issue of representing and encoding (un)certain knowledge of different domains and at different levels of abstraction within such systems has emerged as an unsolved pivotal research problem in AI. The paper is interdisciplinary in nature, being positioned at the intersection of mathematics and AI research, and, to that end, will have two objectives. First, it will focus on critically reviewing key state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research literature on how rough sets and rough set-theoretic frameworks are being employed for (un)certain knowledge representation, e.g., via ontologies and Knowledge Graphs, in AI-based information systems across different domains. Second, based on the aforementioned critical review, it will elucidate research implications and potential research strategies which will inform future research towards developing an integrated mathematical philosophy and mathematico-logical formalism for (un)certain knowledge representation in AI systems.",

        "abstract": "“All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others” is George Orwell’s suggestion of the hierarchy of power in a society where the voices of deception, injustice and subversion are more often heard by those who are manipulated to believe and operate under a particular ideology. The present study is a descriptive-analytical investigation of the selected speeches of political discourse given by the two most influential speakers of Animal Farm (Old Major and Squealer), a novel written by Orwell (1945). To investigate and uncover the ways in which ideology and power relations are subtly reproduced in discourse, we have examined what makes Old Major and Squealer persuasive in the expression of their ideologies. The analysis is grounded on the main tenets and principles of Critical Discourse Analysis. Unlike any other forms of linguistic analysis, the main purpose of CDA is explicitly socio-political, since it seeks to better represent the role of discourse in the reproduction of dominance and power struggle. Therefore, we have adopted Fairclough’s three-dimensional framework: description, interpretation and explanation. In addition, we have capitalized on Aristotle’s approach of persuasion (ethos, pathos and logos) to be as a supporting analytical tool of linguistic and rhetorical devices. Thus, the analytical part of this research work has analyzed the possible interrelatedness of textual properties and their conveyance of a particular ideology by giving it an eclectic treatment as far as the application of framework is concerned. The findings of this investigation uncover the linguistic and rhetorical techniques that contribute to the overall process of persuasion, which have different ideological attachments. The study concludes that the analysis of Fairclough’s three dimensional framework and three modes of persuasion under the main tenets of CDA has shown that politicians – even in a fictional political world – depend significantly on linguistic manipulation to demonstrate ideologies, steer people’s thoughts, manufacture consent and rise to power.",

        "abstract": "This article explores the historical and spatial conditions that necessitated Black ecclesial autonomy in the United States, beginning with Absalom Jones’s appointment as the first Black pastor of a mainstream Christian denomination and culminating in the rise of contemporary Black mega churches. Using the framework of land-use enforcement and religious zoning as outlined in The Evolution of Land-Use Enforcement Related to The Religious Storefront Church Movement (Williams-Peyton, 2019), the article traces how exclusionary zoning, denominational gatekeeping, and intra-racial class tensions shaped the road from Black mainstream denominations to the emergence of storefront churches and their architectural successors. Through historical analysis and visual typology—including Table 2’s storefront church models—this study argues that Black religious space has always been a site of resistance, creativity, and contested legitimacy. Building on this foundation, the article applies Wilson’s Evolution of Information Behavior Modeling (1999) to interpret these spatial and theological adaptations as dynamic responses to information needs. Congregants’ pursuit of sanctified space is framed as information-seeking behavior shaped by environmental, psychological, and social variables. The creation of sovereign pews emerges not only as architectural ingenuity but as informational agency rooted in trauma, resilience, and theological innovation. By situating these ecclesial strategies within a broader information behavior framework, the article bridges urban ministry, LIS theory, and cultural preservation.",

Using Growing Up in Scotland, a nationally representative longitudinal child cohort study of children born in 2004-05, we investigate social inequalities in social work contact for children living with parental domestic violence and abuse (working sample n:3216). Using logit models, we examine associations between self-reported maternal experiences of domestic violence and abuse (when children were aged 0-6 years old), and social work service contact for study-children (across ages 2-7 years old), controlling for socio-demographic factors, illicit substance use, alcohol consumption, parental separation, and maternal mental health. Maternal reports of domestic violence and abuse significantly increased the likelihood of social worker contact for the study-child. Social worker involvement was far more likely in low-income households. Where domestic violence and abuse had been reported, social worker contact was twice as likely for boys than for girls. Findings suggest significant socio-economic disparities and gender discrepancies in the social work service response in the context of domestic violence and abuse. These patterns raise concerns about the potential for social work engagement being stratified by socio-economic status and under-identification of girls’ needs in domestic violence and abuse contexts.",

        "abstract": "Under the threat window of ‘interception first, decryption later’ in quantum computing, national security and industrial sovereignty face new systemic challenges. This paper proposes a dual-track approach of ‘PQC baseline + QKD enhancement’ to comprehensively compare the standard systems, governance models, and engineering progress of China and the United States in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD). The study employs a three-tier evidence integration framework of ‘policy-standards-engineering,’ combining authoritative documents from NIST, OMB, CISA, and other sources with China's national standard platform and industry announcements. It constructs an analysis model of ‘standard hierarchy-migration ecosystem-international interoperability’ and evaluates the feasibility of the scheme through gap-risk mapping, roadmap design, and KPI matrix assessment. The results show that the United States has established a closed-loop system of ‘primary standards + redundancy’ based on FIPS 203/204/205 and HQC backup algorithms, and has entered an auditable implementation phase driven by mandatory migration and toolchain initiatives from OMB and CISA; China maintains an advantage in QKD engineering and standardisation, but national standards for PQC have not yet been solidified, and the migration governance system lags behind, resulting in a structural shortfall of ‘engineering leading the way while algorithm standards lag behind.’ Based on this, this paper proposes a ‘three-year-five-year-ten-year’ national roadmap: establish a standardised baseline within three years, achieve large-scale migration and verification within five years, and complete consolidation and internationalisation within ten years. This will be supplemented by protocols, PKI/certificates, key lifecycle management, testing and certification, and algorithm switching mechanisms, in conjunction with a five-tier governance structure led by the State Cryptography Administration, with TC260/TC485 as the technical focal points, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology/ the Cyberspace Administration of China/People's Bank of China, operator and critical infrastructure implementation, and research institutes. The conclusion states that PQC must be established as the ‘basic defence line’ in the quantum era, while QKD should serve as the ‘enhanced defence line’ for critical links; China must complete the construction of PQC national standards and migration governance capabilities within a three-year standardisation, five-year consolidation, and ten-year internationalisation timeline, and achieve dual-track integration and international interoperability with the QKD standard suite, thereby safeguarding national security, consolidating industrial resilience, and enhancing international influence.",

It also examines the social reasons and identity concerns that result in variation in code-mixing practices among male and female students. The attitudes of students towards code-mixing and the perception of others’ use of it have also been examined. The research reveals that code-mixing practices vary significantly between males and females due to gender differences in identity and students’ responses to social pressure and opportunity at university. Female students mix languages more frequently and in more sophisticated ways because they aspire to be socially accepted and project a modern identity. Male students, on the other hand, employ code-mixing in a more functional way, using it to exhibit academic expertise and professional standing. Overall, the research reveals that mixing English and Bangla is not the same for all people; it is a finely tuned strategy that exhibits gender differences in identity and students’ negotiation with social pressure and opportunity at university.",

Other patterns, like the mean resilience index and the mean travel distance, vary by LLM used.

The Campbell Collaboration does so with its plain language summaries, which aim to communicate complex methodological information in an accessible manner. However, the effectiveness of such summaries in communicating the overall quality of the primary studies included in a systematic review remains understudied. Objectives: This study aims to assess how the design of a systematic review summary affects readers' perception of methodological quality of primary studies, their perception of the evidence's definitiveness and their attitudes towards the policy intervention discussed in the review. Data and Methods: Using a web-based experimental design, two studies were conducted to examine how various presentation formats, including the emphasis on methodological limitations and the use of images, influence readers’ perceptions of information presented in a systematic review summary. Results: Emphasizing methodological limitations significantly reduces readers' perception of the quality of the methods used in the studies included in a systematic review summary. Yet, highlighting methodological limitations does not influence people's perception of the definitiveness of the review findings or their attitude toward related policies. Furthermore, removing the images from the summary’s standard design appears to have minimal effect on how readers interpret information about methodological limitations. Conclusions: Modifications to the traditional summary design can amplify the awareness of laypeople and civil servants regarding methodological limitations in the scientific evidence. However, their way of processing information about these methodological limitations does not automatically propagate the change in attitude regarding methods to a change in attitudes regarding study results and policy options.",

        "abstract": "Fact-checking is met with growing public resistance in Western democracies: contested for its affirmed impartiality. The scholarly debate about the impartiality of the fact-checking practice too is stuck in an endless yo-yo motion: permanently vacillating between claims of being irrevocably unbiased or irremediably subjective. Contributing to Critical Disinformation Studies, the paper demonstrates how a prevailing atomist perception of fake news validates the persistent—though increasingly problematised—modelling of Western fact-checking into an impartial fake news detector. Inspired by Karen Barad’s work, the paper therefore introduces a dual relational-atomist fact-checking model that arguably stands a better chance at receiving public endorsement.",

        "abstract": "Background: Childhood overweight and obesity remain global public health concerns, yet caregiver engagement with prevention and support services is often limited. Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake. Methods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours. Results: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits. Conclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.",

        "abstract": "El presente artículo propone el modelo de Liderazgo Sostenible Integral (MLSI) como una nueva arquitectura teórica para comprender el liderazgo en contextos de complejidad, urgencia e interdependencia. A partir de una revisión crítica de los principales enfoques contemporáneos —incluyendo el liderazgo transformacional, emocional, servidor, auténtico, regenerativo y sostenible clásico— se identifican limitaciones comunes, como la fragmentación entre acción y conciencia, la ausencia de un marco integrado que contemple el equilibrio interno del líder, y la débil articulación entre desempeño, propósito y sostenibilidad ética. El modelo propuesto se organiza en tres componentes interdependientes: (1) competencias generadoras (visión, inteligencia emocional y disciplina), de las cuales emergen habilidades funcionales y posibles distorsiones; (2) conexiones como indicadores de calidad del impacto (interna, social y ecológica); y (3) estado interno como núcleo dinámico desde el cual el líder percibe, decide y actúa, influido por factores narrativos, emocionales, neurobiológicos y contextuales. Este enfoque redefine la sostenibilidad del liderazgo no solo como capacidad de generar resultados duraderos, sino como la habilidad de sostener procesos transformadores sin deteriorar la integridad personal, relacional ni ecológica. Se presentan fundamentos epistemológicos, estructura conceptual y líneas de investigación futuras, incluyendo validación empírica, estudios sobre el estado interno y diseño de programas formativos. El artículo contribuye así a la evolución del campo, proponiendo un liderazgo que integra acción estratégica, profundidad humana y conciencia sistémica.",

        "abstract": "Problematic climate information affects public support for mitigation policies. Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. In this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse. Cluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests. Funded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.",

This provides an overview of the distribution, access and value of social housing stock. The research also develops an Amenity Index. This tool checks whether social housing has good access to local amenities. Why this research is important: social housing is often located in areas with lower amenity. High amenity areas have good access to public transport, schools, medical services, employment opportunities and leisure activities. Many social housing tenants don't have cars. Easy access to services is very important for them. This is especially true for people with complex needs who need medical care and other support services.",
