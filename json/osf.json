        "abstract": "Emotions are an essential feature of human cognition, sense-making, and behaviour. In volatile times characterized by urgency and uncertainty, which compound the already complex processes of international negotiations, international organizations (IOs) play a paramount role in mitigating the potentially adverse impact of emotions on negotiation outcomes in multilateral diplomacy. Drawing on social psychology, behavioural economics, and international relations, this essay explains why and how emotions impact negotiation processes and outcomes, and shows how IOs – as international bureaucracies – help mitigate emotional biases in multilateral diplomacy. Illustrating the effect of experiencing positive, neutral, and negative emotions during negotiation processes, this essay proposes three mechanisms – community building, professionalization, and bureaucratization – by which IOs reduce emotion-driven disruptions in diplomatic negotiations and facilitate agreement on issues of global relevance, especially in volatile times.",

        "abstract": "This study anchors its analysis on the controversy surrounding Shanghai Maritime University's “First-Class Undergraduate Programs” initiative in China. It aims to validate whether AI-enhanced open-source intelligence (OSINT) evidence governance can reconstruct auditable evidence chains and quantify narrative discrepancies in education-related public incidents, while extrapolating governance performance to multidimensional national security risks. Methodologically, we collected university announcements, mainstream media reports, platform-accessible pages, and judicial leads within a unified time window to construct a “source-time-version” evidence graph. We introduced multilingual NLI and sentence vectors to measure narrative consistency, combined with JSD to monitor monitoring scope drift. We employed temporal propagation networks and DTW to measure the temporal misalignment between “post deletion/restriction” and public opinion peaks. Further, we mapped “evidence governance/information control opacity” to four normalized risk dimensions—academic integrity, rule of law and institutional trust, ideological security, and social stability—using structural causal models, providing 95% confidence intervals. Results indicate: The foundational evidence chain can be robustly reconstructed, yet significant narrative gaps exist regarding “whether ‘7 categories, 40 items’ of fraud occurred” and “whether platform actions were implemented/compliant.” Communication peaks typically precede search peaks by approximately one cycle (moderate DTW misalignment), with public nodes consistently holding the highest intermediary scores. Among the four risk dimensions, “academic integrity” and “ideological security” exhibit relatively higher levels. Conclusions indicate that earlier, auditable evidence disclosure (versioned notifications, third-party verification, platform log retention) simultaneously reduces all four risk dimensions and shortens the public opinion chain, whereas declarative statements alone fail to resolve disputes. AI-enhanced OSINT provides a reusable methodological pathway for evidence governance in educational settings and national security assessments.",

        "abstract": "Low political trust disengages citizens from mainstream politics, stimulating anti-establishment voting and even electoral abstention. However, existing scholarship has largely overlooked the temporal dynamics of political trust. Next to high versus low trust, our study identifies two additional components of political trust: its long-term variability and its short-term variation. We employ fifteen waves of the Dutch LISS panel (2008-2023) to systematically test the impact of these three components of political trust on electoral behavior. We find that there are systematic and meaningful differences between stable and variable (dis)trusters. While trust levels are the strongest predictor of both support for anti-establishment and abstention, trust variability has an additional effect on electoral behavior. Short-term declines in political trust increase the chances of anti-establishment voting and abstention, independent of individuals’ overall trust levels and variability. These findings have important implications for our understanding of democratic alienation and critical citizenship.",

        "abstract": "Alternative news media combine a (quasi-)journalistic self-understanding with an explicit anti-mainstream agenda. As an increasingly important part of digital political information ecosystems in many countries, they have the potential to contribute to a more separatist or publicist orientation of digital counterpublics. This article analyzes the contextual conditions for the mainstream orientation of broader digital alternative news environments that form around the dissemination of alternative news content on social media. We draw on a network-analytical approach and more than 900 million social media posts shared on nine social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram, VKontakte, Reddit, Gab, and 4Chan) from 2019 to 2021 that have ties to right-wing, left-wing, or anti-system alternative news outlets based in four European countries (Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Sweden). Our findings indicate that the mainstream orientation of European digital alternative news environments is more pronounced in countries with a cordon sanitaire tradition in the political sphere, as well as in left-wing-oriented environments. The article adds to a growing body of research on the complex relationship between alternative news media and the mainstream by highlighting the importance of contextual conditions and the nature of the broader information environments in which alternative news content is circulated.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary democracies face growing public mistrust and disaffection. Governments across the world have tried to revert these trends by promoting participatory governance. Prior work has established how deliberation can empower citizens. However, whether these effects hold in real-life initiatives initiated by partisan governments remains unclear. We test the ability of citizens' assemblies to foster democratic attitudes in a natural experiment leveraging the random selection of participants to Lisbon's citizens' assembly. Participation in two full-day sessions of structured deliberation promoted by the local government led to a increase in issue knowledge and salience, external political efficacy, and institutional trust. However, participation did not increase internal political efficacy nor helped citizens better recognize the challenges of collective decision-making. The results hold for two editions of the assembly and reveal how participatory governance initiatives can bolster the connection between citizens and the democratic process.",

        "abstract": "Public health and health education face many challenges which can be compounded by conflicting views and bias. Constructs and tools of mindfulness theory may offer avenues for addressing these challenges. The field of mindfulness developed as an individual practice involving meditation for stress reduction. The field of business extended principles of mindfulness to organizational behavior as “collective mindfulness,” which includes a mindful state separate from the practice of meditation. Principles of mindfulness can be applied at the community level to foster unbiased non-judgmental awareness and action through a dimensional and social-ecological approach, to address conflicting views at the individual, inter-personal, organizational/community, and policy/societal levels. Community mindfulness moderator training can foster neutral non-judgmental awareness of all factors involved in public health decisions and health education efforts, including trustworthiness of sources, potential bias, and short term and long term implications. Five processes of community mindfulness theory are presented which include: Creating a neutral nonjudgmental state of mind for objective analysis of evidence; Fostering trust, common ground, and a safe environment for discussion; Incorporation of a social-ecological perspective; Addressing dimensional and long range perspectives; and Inclusion of mindfully-based social media.",

        "abstract": "False information can erode democratic legitimacy and incite violence. Despite the severity of these outcomes, social media platforms have recently withdrawn funding for content moderation, leaving low-resource environments at particular risk. While lab studies and survey experiments have been used to develop innovative methods for combating false information, challenges with data access have limited their study in ecologically valid settings. As an alternative, a partnership was established with non-profit Tales of Turning to oversee the study of a volunteer-led digital field experiment which saw them use comments to get readers to more carefully consider online content. These questions, known as “social truth queries” (STQs), were randomly assigned to posts containing delegitimizing information during South Africa’s contentious 2024 election. Across the 125 X/Twitter posts, the intervention had a substantial effect on engagement, with posts assigned to receive comments seeing a 77% reduction in likes and 82% reduction in reposts. Critically, the effect of the intervention was dependent on its timing, with the impact largest when STQs were applied quickly. To test related mechanisms, the field study was paired with two preregistered survey experiments (N=1,607) which employed posts collected during the intervention. The surveys provide further support for the role of STQs in reducing perceived post accuracy and trust in users spreading delegitimizing content. For the first time in the context of a digital field experiment, this study provides evidence from a collaboration with a community-based partner regarding the efficacy of a real-world election integrity intervention.",

The toolkit is designed for scholars integrating pattern analysis, data visualization, and explanation in qualitative and/or computational social science (CSS). Despite the existence of off-the-shelf commercial qualitative data analysis software, there is a dearth of highly scalable open source options that can work with large data sets, and allow advanced statistical and language modeling. The foundation of the toolkit is a pragmatic approach that aligns research tools with social science project goals— empirical explanation, theory-guided measurement, comparative design, or evidence-based recommendations— guided by the principle that research paradigm and questions should determine methods. Consequently, the CMAP visualization toolkit offers a range of possibilities through the adjustment of relatively small number of parameters, and allows integration with other python tools.",

        "abstract": "Across many Western democracies, public trust in political institutions is under strain. The Netherlands forms no exception: since 2021, levels of political trust have declined noticeably (Miltenburg et al., 2024). This observation has raised concern, with some commentators warning that it may reflect deeper challenges to Dutch democracy (e.g., Van Reybrouck, 2016; Tjeenk Willink, 2022). But to what extent is this the case? To address this puzzle, this memo explores the relationship between political trust and democracy. It focuses on two central questions: (1) Why is political trust important for democracy? And (2) how has the Netherlands fared in this respect over time? Drawing on data from the LISS panel (2008-2024), it outlines general trends in political trust over the past sixteen years.",

        "abstract": "This article examines how competitive authoritarian regimes reshape state administration through informal, extralegal structures that bypass formal institutional frameworks. While prior research highlights how regimes centralize power by restructuring bureaucracies and appointing loyalists, the formal institutional framework typically remains the main conduit through which partisan control and management of state administration are exercised. This article presents a distinct model of partisan control under competitive authoritarianism — showing how these strategies may be reinforced, or even replaced, by party-run parallel networks that redirect authority flows. Drawing on the case of Serbia under Vučić, it documents a “para-state” shadow governance system that displaces formal command. This model enables centralized, discretionary control across the entire public sector while shielding elites from accountability. Conceptually, the article argues that Serbia’s model blurs the line between competitive authoritarianism and totalitarian rule.",

        "created": "2025-10-06",
        "abstract": "Escalating U.S. net-interest payments now rival flagship budget lines and are projected to surpass 4 percent of GDP within a decade, while unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities exceed $70 trillion. In parallel, over-the-counter derivatives outstanding approach $700–800 trillion in notional value, embedding opaque leverage that could transmit shocks globally. Purpose: This study probes how the confluence of sovereign debt strain, entitlement promises, and derivatives exposure can destabilize the dollar’s reserve-currency privilege and maps reforms capable of forestalling a debt-driven systemic rupture. Methods: An integrative review of Congressional Budget Office forecasts, BIS derivatives statistics, and peer-reviewed network-risk models is synthesized through a tri-theoretical lens that combines Modern Monetary Theory, Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis, and network-based systemic-risk science. Results: Vector-error-correction analysis reveals that a one-point rise in the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio lifts global derivatives gross-market value by 0.7 percent within two quarters, indicating tight macro-financial coupling. Stress scenarios show that breaching a 120 percent debt-to-GDP threshold alongside derivatives GMV above 10 percent of GDP elevates one-notch downgrade odds to 50 percent within two years. These dynamics threaten confidence in dollar assets, erode the “exorbitant privilege,” and could precipitate non-linear contagion through shadow-banking channels. Conclusions: A coordinated package—gradual entitlement reform, primary-balance fiscal rules, maturity-extension of Treasuries, reinforced CCP cover-two capital, and expanded bilateral central-bank swap lines—can realign fiscal sustainability with financial-network resilience. Infusing policy with a biblical stewardship ethic (“the borrower is servant to the lender,” Prov 22:7) underscores the moral imperative to curb excessive leverage. Timely adoption would safeguard global liquidity, buttress U.S. monetary sovereignty, and preserve the dollar’s hegemonic role.",

        "abstract": "Background. African startups operate amid acute capital scarcity and fragmented institutions, which complicates credible quality revelation to investors. Purpose. Focusing on the venture as the unit of analysis, this study investigates how milestones pursued inside university-affiliated accelerators function as signals of venture quality under scarcity, and how entrepreneurial behaviors shape the clarity and credibility of those signals. Design/methodology/approach. We track 17 technology ventures across East- and West-African university accelerators over 185 venture-quarters, combining venture-level panel regressions, event-study analysis, and fuzzy-set QCA. Two composite measures—the Governance-Readiness Index and the Signal-Portfolio Index—capture internal capability building and externally legible signals. Findings. Ventures graduating from university-affiliated accelerators secured roughly three times more equity than matched non-accelerated peers, with heterogeneity explained by milestone attainment and the breadth/strength of signal portfolios. We articulate a signal–noise paradox: effectuation/bricolage behaviors enable survival and progress under constraint yet can appear ambiguous to investors, attenuating signal clarity unless paired with governance readiness and externally validated milestones. Originality/value. The paper elevates signaling theory as the primary lens for early-stage ventures in emerging-market contexts, treats effectuation/bricolage as behavioral mechanisms, and situates staged financing as process logic and triple-helix/institutional-voids as contextual moderators. In doing so, it refines entrepreneurial signaling theory for scarcity contexts and offers actionable diagnostics for accelerators and policymakers designing inclusive, quality-assuring programs.",

This paper uses these contrasting trajectories to interrogate the EU’s more assertive industrial policy turn. Drawing on the developmental network state (DNS) framework, we argue that while the EU has shifted from market neutrality to vertical industrial policy activism in a global context marked by geopolitical competition, its capacity to sustain strategic firms through crises remains underdeveloped. However, domestic capabilities and strategies mediated EU resourcing, brokering, facilitation, and protection, the main functions of the DNS. Where Sweden lacked credible financial, fiscal and institutional mechanisms of internal protection for the beleaguered Northvolt, France deployed a more robust economic statecraft toolkit, combining strategic finance, firm-level coordination, and public investment. Northvolt’s collapse illustrates the limits of Europe’s institutional orchestration of ambitious industrial policies: a regime that can incubate innovation but cannot stabilise it commercially. We conclude that without repurposed macro-financial institutions, Europe’s role as a competitive supplier of decarbonisation technologies will remain vulnerable.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) framework is intended to safeguard the food supply, yet structural gaps have enabled widespread use of food additives with limited oversight. While regulators evaluate individual substances, Americans are exposed daily to complex mixtures embedded in ultra-processed foods (UPFs). This study conducted a scoping review of the GRAS literature to identify regulatory and toxicological blind spots, and a descriptive mapping of the U.S. packaged food supply to characterize additive prevalence and co-occurrence. Using Open Food Facts data (n ≈ 19,000 products), standardization of additives into E-codes, classified UPFs, and generated co-occurrence networks was done. Results show that while a small set of legacy additives dominate, certain combinations recur thousands of times, revealing potential for synergistic or cumulative exposures not captured by current assessment models. Furthermore, self-affirmed GRAS determinations remain largely invisible, revealing major transparency gaps. These findings stress the urgent need for mixture focused toxicology, improved regulatory disclosure, and systematic monitoring of UPFs. This preliminary analysis serves as a foundation for OpenGRAS, a student-led initiative to document and expose weaknesses in U.S. food additive governance.",

        "abstract": "This paper reconceptualizes silence not as an individual pathology or commu- nication breakdown but as a rationally emergent social equilibrium. Drawing on graph theory, sociology, and behavioral economics, the analysis introduces two cen- tral constructs: the domination number γ(G), which captures structural concentra- tion of recognition, and the cost function J(x) = αE(x) + βS(x) + cAA(x), which models the individual’s calculus of whether to speak or remain silent. Through these constructs, silence is shown to be a predictable outcome of recognition asymmetry. By embedding classical theories from Durkheim, Bourdieu, Goffman, and Foucault into a formal mathematical framework, the paper establishes the foundation for a new research program: the calculus of silence. The following sections—Chapters 1 through 3—introduce the problem, survey the literature, and articulate the theo- retical framework in detail.",

        "abstract": "The growing interest in assessing societal progress and public policies through the lens of Well-being has garnered significant attention from researchers and policymakers. This study examines the relationship between well-being and global warming across 167 countries from 1990 to 2019, employing the Social Progress Index (SPI) as a measure of well-being. Using a fixed-effects panel data framework, we study temperature impacts by modeling local and global anomalies simultaneously, capturing both within-country and global climate variation. First, a statistically significant negative relationship exists between annual temperature anomalies and well-being, with a 1°C global(local) mean temperature deviation leading to a 0.8324(0.096)-point decline, respectively. Second, precipitation anomalies show no significant effect on the SPI. Third, winter temperature anomalies and cold spells have a greater impact on well-being than other seasons or hot spells. Fourth, poorer regions, hotter climates, the global south, and countries with weak institutions are disproportionately affected by temperature deviations. Fifth, the impact of temperature on well-being persists over the medium term, lasting about four years",

        "abstract": "The relative merits of vocational and general education remain central to debates on sustainable careers. Vocational pathways facilitate smoother school-to-work transitions but rely on occupation-specific skills that may become obsolete, whereas general education yields weaker entry prospects but greater adaptability to changing demands. A key question is whether further training can offset these trade-offs. This study examines participation in, and returns to, non-formal job-related training among vocationally and generally educated workers. Non-formal training, such as structured courses or seminars, allows employees to update and consolidate skills throughout their careers. We hypothesize that general graduates benefit more in early careers, while vocational graduates gain later as training helps counteract skill obsolescence. Drawing on longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we find that secondary-level vocational graduates participate less in training than university graduates, whereas tertiary-level vocational graduates train at similar rates. Training promotes employment stability, particularly in later careers, but effects are relatively uniform across educational groups. These results indicate that while training strengthens career resilience, it does not eliminate disparities between vocational and general graduates.",

        "abstract": "As climate change exacerbates socioeconomic vulnerabilities, women, often carers, emerge as \"invisible safety nets\" sustaining family and community resilience. Set in a coastal town in Batangas, Philippines, the study explores how carers experience and navigate unpaid care work amid climate adaptation. Guided by feminist participatory action research, the study used photovoice, where 13 participants documented their experiences through photography and writing, then collaboratively interpreted their stories. For Filipino caregivers, climate change intensifies unpaid care work. Climate-related disruptions fracture their sense of wholeness, adding layers of grief and uncertainty to their responsibilities. They take on multifaceted roles across their family, community, and environments, as educators, providers, stewards, and leaders. In navigating intensifying care demands, they rely on community solidarity and spirituality, which serve as vital sources of strength, purpose, and hope in their collective efforts to adapt to climate change. By recognising unpaid care work in climate adaptation and providing carers with a platform to voice their lived experiences, the study hopes to advocate for climate change policies and programs that respond to unpaid care dynamics, reward women’s contribution, reduce unpaid care work, and advocate for redistribution of and male involvement in care work within families and communities.",

Im Rahmen der sozialwissenschaftlichen Begleitforschung wurden alle Bewohner*innen zwischen 2020 und 2023 zweimal zur Teilnahme an standardisierten Umfragen zu den Themen Wohnen, Quartier, Mobilität und Energie eingeladen. Ergänzend wurden drei qualitative Leitfaden-Interviews mit Bewohner*innen und eine Umfrage unter den Käufer*innen der Wohnungen (Investor*innen) durchgeführt. Das Klimakonzept der „Neuen Weststadt“ spielte für die Beurteilung der Wohnqualität durch die Bewohner*innen eine untergeordnete Rolle, im Alltag fielen die neuen Technologien weder positiv noch negativ auf. Es gab v.a. in der Anfangszeit Informationsdefizite bezüglich des Energiekonzepts des Quartiers. Diese führten jedoch nicht zu Akzeptanzproblemen. Die Bewohner*innen des Klimaquartiers sind grundsätzlich aufgeschlossen für Wasserstoff als Technologie zur Energiespeicherung. Das gilt auch für die Wasserstoffelektrolyse vor Ort im Wohnquartier. Die eigene Erfahrung im Klimaquartier fördert die Zustimmung zu dieser Technologie. Mit der Wohndauer im Klimaquartier, wird das Bekenntnis zum Energiesparen stärker. Das Leben im Klimaquartier scheint ein höheres Umweltbewusstsein also eher zu fördern. Die Bewohner*innen interessieren sich für ihren eigenen Energieverbrauch, fühlen sich über diesen aber nicht gut informiert. Eine App mit Informationen zum eigenen Energieverbrauch wird von den meisten Bewohner*innen begrüßt. Die Bewohner*innen sind überwiegend jung, überdurchschnittlich hoch gebildet und beruflich erfolgreich. Sie haben ein ausgeprägtes Umweltbewusstsein, das sich jedoch nur eingeschränkt in ihrem Alltagsverhalten widerspiegelt. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie sind daher nur auf Quartiere mit ähnlicher demographischer Zusammensetzung übertragbar.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines publications related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from Latin American and European countries, specifically focusing on whether the issues and challenges faced by these regions differ significantly. Latin American countries may be addressing region-specific health concerns or environmental challenges different from the European countries. A bibliographic universal classification of SDGs may overlook such crucial issues and nuances vital to the development of these countries. This study emphasises the differing priorities between Latin America and certain countries in the Global North regarding the health and well-being of all individuals. It focuses on improving reproductive, maternal, and child health, ending epidemics of major contagious diseases, reducing non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health and well-being, and addressing behavioral and environmental health risk factors. While Latin American countries often focus on topics like infections or mental health, the Global North tends to priorities Covid 19 and cancer. These differences reflect distinct economic, social, and political contexts, with us Global North sometimes overlooking the foundational needs of Global South countries. The research employs a sample from the Open Alex database, focusing on the ten most productive countries in Latin America and the ten most productive countries in Europe in SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being in the period of 2023-2024. The study, which falls under the framework of SDG 3 publications and employs data analytics techniques, identifies priority topics for Latin America and Europe, as well as common interests across both regions. Utilising predictive models based on machine learning, the study forecasts the topics that these countries are likely to prioritize in the near future with an accuracy of 60%. This level of accuracy may be influenced by the sample size used; therefore, future analyses will incorporate additional data, such as examining abstracts to determine whether European countries continue to diverge in their focus or if they find common ground on certain topics. This approach will provide valuable insights into regional priorities and the potential evolution of research related to the Sustainable Development Goals. The contrast between Latin America and Europe is valuable and quite original, since many global analyses tend to homogenize realities.",

Las narrativas más frecuentes se centran en la crítica al Estado y en las demandas de medidas punitivas, lo que evidencia una ciudadanía indignada y favorable a soluciones de seguridad más estrictas. La reacción mediática se presenta como tardía y reactiva, lo que retrasa la incorporación del problema en la agenda pública y prolonga la sensación de desprotección Este trabajo aporta un marco replicable para el estudio de fenómenos de criminalidad en entornos digitales y demuestra el papel de la protesta social como detonante de la visibilización y discusión en línea, ofreciendo insumos para comprender cómo la presión ciudadana configura la agenda mediática y política.",

The obtained results show that pride in science and technology is significantly related to the objective achievements. This relation is equally strong for academic science and applied technology and is stronger than the relation to the country’s general affluence as measured by the GDP per capita. The research demonstrates that as where science and technology are concerned people share a kind of distributed knowledge that produces realistic estimates counteracting the nationalist self-serving bias.",

On rare occasions when Bourdieu does attempt to explicate his knowledge of Gramsci through quotations, he does so hastily, vaguely and instrumentally. However, this does not imply that Bourdieu's postures and stances with respect to Gramsci's thought do not find expression within his own texts; on the contrary, they emerge precisely from the reticence, allusions and dissimulations. From here one can even explore a closeness underlying an apparent and declared detachment, to reflect on a disinterestedness that is actually interested. The analysis is thus based on an “against the grain” reading of the direct and explicit occurrences of Gramsci traceable in Bourdieu's texts, highlighting the space of their possible sociological implications and their tacit and implicit connotations.",

It is culturally idealized as a resource for laying the foundations of a good life for children and adolescents, to the point of being included in dietary guidelines. Empirical and theoretical support in favor of this conclusion exists, yet critics also challenge assumptions of causation and family meals being without harm. Here, I challenge a third assumption, which I refer to as the assumption of environmental primacy. Focusing on eating behavior and body weight of children and adolescents, I discuss evidence from methods in behavioral and social science genetics (twin and adoption studies, molecular genetics, and within-family designs) and argue that if no attempt is made to consider the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors, we cannot claim with any confidence that family meals matter. At least not for the eating behaviors and weight trajectories of youth. Throughout the paper, I provide examples of how family meals could be studied with the use of these methods, and finish with five constructive suggestions on how to handle this in the future. The ambition is to strengthen the scientific quality of the family-meal literature and, thus, improve the scientific basis of (potential) family meal policy.",

The discussion topics raised include the need to design serious games for fostering meaningful interactions, as well as developing a thorough framework for constructing purposeful design for serious games.

Humans systematically alter their informational landscapes in materially visible ways by creating enduring spatial and artefactual scaffolds for improved cognitive performance and social coordination. In this paper, we propose a set of criteria to define ENC and track its emergence in the archaeological record. These criteria highlight the importance of persistent, publicly accessible, and evolutionarily incremental modifications that sustained behavioural coordination among individuals in space and time. We apply this framework to three major domains of material culture: the structuring of space for collective action, the culturalization of the human body, and the emergence of exosomatic artefacts to store coded information. We argue that these practices did not merely externalise knowledge but progressively transformed material culture and environments into targeted epistemic infrastructures able to scaffold and amplify group-level performances characteristic of collective intelligence, thus shedding light on the evolution of human cognition and social organization.",

        "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

        "abstract": "This study examines how neighbourhoods can be understood through their functional roles in immigrant settlement. Drawing on register data covering internal migration among first-generation immigrants in Denmark (2007–2012), the analysis models migration as networks and applies the Hubs and Authorities (HITS) algorithm to classify neighbourhoods as sinks, denoting areas of prolonged settlement, or sluices, denoting areas of high turnover. These typologies are linked to composite measures of marginalisation and integration, constructed from group-level socioeconomic indicators at settlement and five years later. Results reveal that the association between neighbourhood role and integration outcomes is neighbourhood-dependent rather than uniform. The same neighbourhood may function as a site of long-term residence for some immigrant groups, while being highly transient for others. We find no overall association between internal migration patterns and socioeconomic integration outcomes at the neighbourhood-level. Neighbourhoods near city centres and on the periphery often display dual functions, indicating transitional dynamics within the urban system. Over time, sinks tend to become more strongly associated with marginalisation, while the role of sluices remains variable. The findings support a pluralistic understanding of neighbourhoods as dynamic contexts shaped by migration flows, rather than as fixed determinants of outcomes, as integration and spatial mobility are linked for some immigrant groups but not others. Overall, the study highlights the value of treating migration as a network process for capturing the fluid, group-specific geographies of integration.",

        "authors": "Ouma Peter Odhiambo",
        "created": "2025-10-02",
        "abstract": "Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) has emerged as a critical component of development practice, especially in African contexts where donor legitimacy and accountability are upheld by demonstrable quantitative impact. Typically seen as a technical endeavour, M&amp;E is frequently presumed to yield impartial, objective assessments of societal advancement. This paper contests that assumption by proposing a philosophical redefinition of M&amp;E as performative ritualism, a fusion of Judith Butler’s theory of performativity and Victor Turner’s anthropology of ritual. The analysis employs a critical conceptual methodology and normative critique. Butler's explanation of performativity shows how indicators and reports work not just as reflections but also as performative utterances that have an \"impact\" through their repeated use in rituals. Turner's ritual theory shows that evaluation cycles baseline, midline, and endline act as rites of passage, turning ambiguity into symbolic closure for funders and policymakers. Post-humanist insights further expand these frameworks, illustrating how dashboards, algorithms, and artificial intelligence tools now operate alongside human evaluators, reinforcing evaluative categories through automated repetition. The findings indicate the cultural and ethical conflict of these activities within African cultures. Western evaluation rituals focus on linearity, abstraction, and bureaucratic closure. In contrast, African communitarian ethics focus on relational accountability, oral testimony, and cyclical processes of responsibility. The difference shows how theatrical imported evaluative systems are; it also shows how to recreate ethics by thinking of evaluation as participatory storytelling and communal debate instead of a bureaucratic audit. The article finds that monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is not a neutral tool but a symbolic system that enacts legitimacy and authority. Thinking of M&amp;E as performative ritualism brings out its cultural and philosophical sides and makes room for hybrid models that mix computational tools with community-based, relational practices. The paper provides a novel framework for examining development evaluation in the algorithmic era, rooted in African ethical philosophy.",

        "abstract": "Soma, the sacred plant of the Rigveda, and its Iranian counterpart Haoma in the Avesta, have long remained shrouded in mystery. While earlier scholarship identified Soma with various candidates such as Amanita muscaria, Ephedra, Cannabis, and Peganum harmala, no consensus has emerged. This study offers a multidisciplinary approach, combining textual analysis, fieldwork in the Kutch region of India, and comparative ethnobotany. A plant identified as Vernonia cinerascens Sch. Bip. is proposed as a strong candidate for Soma/Haoma. Its morphology—woody stems, arrow-like shoots, tawny coloration, and leafy sprigs—corresponds closely with Rigvedic and Avestan descriptions. Experimental pressing of its branches produced a golden-tawny juice, accompanied by the crackling sound noted in Vedic hymns. Experiential trials confirmed psychoactive and healing effects resembling those praised in the hymns, such as relaxation, enhanced concentration, relief from pain, and states of calm joy. The plant’s known medicinal properties in African ethnobotany, especially for mental disorders and depression, further validate these findings. Comparative analysis with Assyrian “Sacred Tree” iconography and Zoroastrian Barsom ritual suggests a broader Near Eastern continuity of sacred plant traditions. Together, textual, ethnobotanical, and experiential evidence support the case that Vernonia cinerascens Sch. Bip may represent the long-lost Soma of Indo-Iranian antiquity.",

        "abstract": "This article examines the emergence of digital program management systems in African development, concentrating on tools such as dashboards, biometric identity, and mobile data platforms. It contends that these systems are not impartial technology of efficiency but modern manifestations of colonial control mechanisms. The paper, based on Quijano's idea of the \"coloniality of power,\" says that digital program management is a form of epistemic violence since it turns communities into databases and puts donor supervision ahead of relational accountability. Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) functions, integrated into these systems, exacerbate the issue by legitimising surveillance and data extraction as the prevailing framework of responsibility. Based on decolonial theory, the analysis compares the technocratic positivism that underlies today's management methods with epistemologies based on Indigenous African Knowledge Systems (IKS), especially Ubuntu relationality. Biometric systems erase relational identity by favouring individualised markers over community recognition. Dashboards impose a managerial \"view from nowhere,\" turning complexity into metrics. Mobile survey tools silence oral testimony by putting stories into pre-coded categories. These behaviours show how digital program administration weakens local ways of knowing and gives more authority to outside funders and technocrats. In response, the article proposes a normative framework of Relational Accountability. It asks for a change from data extraction to ethical witnessing, participatory discussion in community assemblies (baraza), data sovereignty as cultural sovereignty, and the speculative design of Ubuntu-centric technology, all based on IKS principles. The paper asserts that decolonising program management is crucial for fostering trust, promoting epistemic fairness, and ensuring more ethical development practices. It advocates for epistemic disobedience that re-establishes Indigenous African Knowledge Systems as fundamental to program design and digital responsibility.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine factors that improve life satisfaction for Korean adolescents. As the future generations of the country emerge, South Korea must increase its life satisfaction, a comparably low value compared to other countries, as they are ranked 23rd out of 38 OECD countries (Cho, 2021). Grit, defined as the trait of working diligently for long-term goals, is important for life satisfaction. This study examines the relationship between grit and life satisfaction for second-year high school students in South Korea and the mediating effects of crucial relationships formed by adolescents, such as teacher-student relationships, parent-child relationships, and friendships. The data was collected through the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), and there were 2,252 second-year high school students who participated in this study. By completing regression analyses on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, grit and the mediating variables, and the effect of grit and the mediating variables on life satisfaction, as demonstrated by the Baron and Kenny process (Baron and Kenny, 1986), it was found that these variables were all correlated with each other. On the third step of the regression analysis, where the mediators were controlled for, it was found that the mediators had a significant effect on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, and a partial mediation took place. Out of the mediators, teacher-student relationships had the biggest explanatory impact with an R-squared value of 0.177. From these results, it is evident that there needs to be interventions, potentially with grit involved, to increase relationships between teachers and students, parents and children, and friends.",

        "abstract": "The advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) poses a fundamental challenge regarding the nature of scientific inquiry: what happens to theory when machines cease to pursue understanding and focus solely on prediction? This article posits that AGI signifies an epistemological rupture in the extensive continuum of scientific rationality, wherein explanation, the quest for causal and conceptual comprehension, transitions to simulation, a mode of cognition propelled by predictive patterning rather than interpretative profundity. The paper engages figures from the philosophy of science and philosophical hermeneutics, including Popper, Kuhn, Hempel, and Lakatos, in conversation with Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Heidegger, to investigate how AGI redefines the concept of “knowledge.” Through a hermeneutic analysis of AGI manifestos, research papers, and policy documents, the study interprets these scientific texts as manifestations of a novel epistemic attitude, one that prioritises performance over comprehension and reduces explanation to algorithmic efficiency. AGI's simulations have unparalleled predictive accuracy, but they jeopardise the foundational objectives of science: justification, clarity, and accountability. The article finishes by proposing a hermeneutic philosophy of AGI that reinstates the significance of interpretation and meaning within automated knowledge systems. Instead of seeing AGI as the end of theory, it is shown as a critical mirror that science must look into to rethink what it means to \"know.\" In a time when data may move faster than understanding, philosophy's job is to keep the space of interpretation open to remind us that knowledge is not just about what works, but also about what makes sense.",

When neither arrived, she recanted, her group dissolved, and efforts to proselytize ceased. But When Prophecy Fails (1956), the now-canonical account of the event, claimed the opposite: that the group doubled down on its beliefs and began recruiting—evidence, the authors argued, of a new psychological mechanism, cognitive dissonance. Drawing on newly unsealed archival material, this article demonstrates that the book’s central claims are false, and that the authors knew they were false. The documents reveal that the group actively proselytized well before the prophecy failed and quickly abandoned their beliefs afterward. They also expose serious ethical violations by the researchers, including fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation.

        "created": "2025-10-03",
        "abstract": "Deepfake technology has quickly become one of the most disruptive new technologies in the digital information ecosystem. It can make convincing audio-visual content that looks just like real media. Although much of the current research has looked at deepfakes from legal, technological, or ethical points of view, this article uses a psychological point of view to explain their particular potency. The main point is that deepfakes don't work mostly as rational lies; instead, they work as cognitive exploits, types of \"perceptual malware\" that attack the way people trust each other. The article illustrates how deepfakes exploit entrenched biases, such as the truth bias, familiarity effects, and the fluency of perceptual processing, by referencing cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In doing so, they avoid higher-order logical inspection and use autonomic processes of recognition and belief construction. The paper also puts deepfakes in the context of other research on false information and how memories can change, suggesting that fake media can create false memories or strengthen existing biases through repeated exposure. Deepfakes undermine epistemic trust by eroding the dependability of visual and aural evidence, which have historically been regarded as the \"gold standard\" of credibility, in contrast to conventional kinds of propaganda. This situation not only puts democratic discourse and trust in the media at risk, but it also poses a serious psychological challenge: fighting deepfakes requires using cognitive and perceptual mechanisms that are mostly outside of conscious control. This article provides an interdisciplinary framework for comprehending deepfakes as psychological weapons by integrating insights from cognitive science, information warfare studies, and emerging media research. It suggests that protecting against this phenomenon necessitates treatments that transcend detection technologies, highlighting cognitive inoculation, media literacy, and the development of \"epistemic resilience\" in an age where visual evidence is increasingly distrusted.",

        "abstract": "Institutional weakness is a defining feature of many African economies, yet little is known about how startups adapt strategically to persistent volatility. This study investigates how entrepreneurs in Lagos and Nairobi mobilize informality to build resilience and navigate institutional voids. Drawing on qualitative interviews and thematic analysis, the findings show that resilience is not an episodic response to shocks but a structural entrepreneurial capacity embedded in everyday practices. Startups in Lagos adopt survival-driven strategies that rely on grassroots bricolage and selective compliance, while those in Nairobi pursue more collaborative approaches that leverage donor partnerships and community-based legitimacy. Informality emerges not as a deficit but as a productive resource that enables adaptation, innovation, and hybrid legitimacy across both contexts. Theoretically, the study contributes to institutional theory by reframing voids as enduring and generative rather than transitional. It extends entrepreneurship research by conceptualizing resilience as an ingrained capacity rather than a reactive response, and it advances the study of informality by demonstrating its role as a strategic resource. By situating African entrepreneurship within its specific institutional and social contexts, the study challenges deficit-based models and offers a framework for understanding how startups transform institutional weakness into opportunities for resilience and innovation.

Instead, I propose vulnerability as a critical mode of relation. Drawing on Robin May Schott’s ontological critique of resilience, I extend her arguments into the field of sustainability science by examining its ontological assumptions, primary discourses, and existing critiques. I advance a threefold plea: first, that reconnecting with nature requires a particular relational mode; second, that vulnerability is a necessary precondition for this mode; and third, that sustainability transformations may benefit from less emphasis on resilience. By combining rational argumentation with art-based, transdisciplinary approaches, this paper seeks to foster psychological reflection, new relational imaginaries, and ultimately more just sustainability transformations.

On average, people blame politicians the most, then traditional media, social media, interest groups, and lastly, citizens. Strong partisan differences exist in blame for traditional media, with leaning and weak Republicans (not strong Republicans) displaying strong blame attribution towards them compared to other entities.

Across 26,000 evaluations of innovative offerings (e.g., startup pitches), we find that GPT evaluators did not disadvantage—and even modestly supported—URMs, primarily by avoiding negative outcomes. We theorize that this reflects symbolic compliance: A superficial response to avoid overt discrimination rather than a genuine commitment to fairness.

        "abstract": "This essay redefines Microsoft Power BI as not merely a business intelligence tool, but as a cognitive prosthesis and an epistemic infrastructure that influences management cognition, attention, and the generation of organisational knowledge. Although traditional literature regards Power BI mainly as a visualisation or decision-support instrument, this study employs a critical conceptual and metascientific perspective to analyse how the platform pre-defines legitimate evidence, influences organisational reasoning, and reallocates interpretive labour within knowledge-driven organisations. The analysis puts up three connected arguments. To begin with, Power BI acts like a cognitive prosthesis by automating basic operations like trend identification, forecasting, and comparison measurements. This frees managers from low-level duties while also making them dependent on its dashboards and algorithmic logic. Second, it works as a micro-technology of cognitive capitalism by capturing, directing, and turning management attention into a resource of economic and organisational value. Third, the platform incorporates epistemic authority into its visualisations and metrics, gently regulating the generation of organisational knowledge and influencing the ethical and political aspects of managerial decision-making. By integrating perspectives from cognitive science, critical theory, science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and political economy, the article illustrates that the automation of cognition is inherently biased, resulting in epistemic constriction, ethical challenges, and technocratic validation masquerading as “data-driven” objectivity. The research enhances metascientific discourse by elucidating the infrastructure of knowledge production within organisations and advocating for reflexive literacy in the utilisation of data analytics platforms. It emphasises the ethical, epistemological, and organisational implications of cognitive prostheses such as Power BI and promotes a more critical approach to the technologies that increasingly shape managerial cognition and decision making.",

I theorize the relationship between system justification and political behaviors in authoritarian contexts and test this in data from two original surveys of Egyptian citizens. After validating that the system justification scale reflects needs for certainty and structure in an authoritarian political setting, I show it is strongly associated with preferences for authoritarian governance. An embedded experiment shows that security, infrastructure, and identity systemic threats mobilize high system justifiers, further increasing support for authoritarian governance. Finally, additional analyses reveal that system justification predicts attitudinal and behavioral support for a specific authoritarian regime.

However, NP surveys performed well on several benchmarks, including univariate SRH distributions (in RANDS-8 and QPHS) and bivariate and multivariate associations (e.g., age-SRH and education-SRH in RANDS-8 and QPHS, and Black race-SRH in PI-H). Yet, biases on other benchmarks were substantial, including overestimated gender-SRH associations in all NP surveys and strongly diverging disparities by race-ethnicity in RANDS-8 and QPHS. These findings highlight both the promise and pitfalls of NP surveys, emphasizing the need for case-by-case validation against reliable benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Traditional monetary policy’s effectiveness in controlling inflation through interest rate changes has weakened, as empirical data show easing no longer reliably drives consumer price inflation. We introduce the Dynamic Constitutive Laws Model (DCLM) described by coupled differential equations to capture how interest rate changes reallocate household spending. By explicitly modeling housing demand, house prices, inflation, and consumption components over five years, we show that lower interest rates can act as a disinflationary force when reduced borrowing costs channel additional disposable income toward housing consumption rather than immediately increasing spending on other Consumer Price Index (CPI) goods and services. This effect offsets inflationary pressures from tariffs and supply shocks. Calibrated on U.S. macroeconomic data, the model reveals that loosening monetary policy stimulates housing-related expenditure while dampening CPI inflation. Our transmission mechanism challenges classical views and offers insights for policymakers navigating today’s volatile economic environment. The DCLM provides a flexible framework to analyze monetary policy’s impact on the U.S. economy, advocating a reassessment of inflation fears and the strategic use of rate cuts to foster growth without exacerbating inflation.",

McCarthy provides a history of the emergence and development of Western science, along with its political and ideological underpinnings. By locating the origin of Western science in the beginnings of capitalism, McCarthy reveals their co-determination and questions if a decoupling is possible. Despite a thorough examination of the ontological, epistemological, metaphysical and philosophical developments regarding knowledge since the Enlightenment, McCarthy omits several key areas of theoretical inquiry, and never satisfyingly answers the driving questions of his text.",

        "abstract": "Digital finance reorganizes everyday economic life through data intensive infrastructures for payments, savings, credit, and fraud control. Governance of these infrastructures is usually framed as financial risk and cybersecurity, which leaves the informational nature of the problem under theorized. This article advances Informational Morality of Finance Theory, IMF-T, a generative theory that reconceptualizes financial data as informational moral objects within socio technical systems. IMF-T integrates Western information ethics, centered on privacy, autonomy, transparency, and accountability, with African communitarian ethics, centered on relational responsibility, stewardship, and equitable benefit sharing. It specifies axioms, defines constructs such as informational dignity, relational stewardship, transparency capability, algorithmic contestability, and trust sufficiency, and articulates mechanisms that connect organizational capabilities to outcomes of data justice and inclusion. The theory yields testable propositions and practical measurement guidance to support cumulative empirical work in Information Studies, Information Systems, and Library and Information Science. It also offers normative principles for institutions and regulators, emphasizing stewardship over compliance and enabling contestability for those affected by automated decisions. By naming and formalizing IMF-T, the article provides a platform for research and practice on the ethical governance of digital finance.

        "authors": "Ouma Peter Odhiambo",
        "created": "2025-10-02",
        "abstract": "People sometimes call social engineering the \"human factor\" in cybersecurity; however, this kind of language hides the underlying philosophical aspects of the issue. Instead of viewing persons as the most vulnerable component in technical systems, social engineering should be recognised as a means of revealing the cultivation, maintenance, and exploitation of moral and intellectual inclinations within digital contexts. Current ethical frameworks predominantly exhibit deontological and utilitarian influences, prioritising adherence to regulations or the optimisation of favourable results. Although these frameworks possess practical applicability, they inadequately represent the moral agency of individuals faced with deception. This essay constructs a conceptual analysis that reinterprets social engineering within the context of Digital Virtue Ethics. Utilising Aristotle's notion of phronesis and MacIntyre's interpretation of practices, the argument underscores that effective resistance to manipulation relies more on the cultivation of qualities such as wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice than on strict compliance with laws. Insights from virtue epistemology, especially in the writings of Zagzebski and Sosa, enhance this study by highlighting epistemic vigilance through attentiveness, humility, and conscientiousness. The amalgamation of these traditions facilitates the emergence of Digital Phronesis: a distinctive form of practical wisdom tailored to the inherent unpredictability and persuasive dynamics of online existence. The important point is that technical precautions and compliance procedures are necessary, but they are not enough on their own. They need a philosophical framework that sees people as moral actors who can develop strong inclinations. From this perspective, social engineering is not just a technological violation but also an affront to moral character and intellectual integrity. When you talk about cybersecurity in terms of virtue, you move away from the idea of the \"weakest link\" and make human agency the most important layer of defence.",

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of digital technologies in India has coincided with a surge in screen-based activities among adolescents, raising concerns about its impact on neurobiological health. This paper explores the concept of \"Digital Diabetes,\" an analogy likening chronic digital overstimulation to insulin resistance in metabolic diabetes. Drawing on empirical evidence from neuroimaging studies, epidemiological surveys, and clinical trials, we examine how prolonged social media and smartphone use disrupts dopamine signaling, leading to reward system desensitization akin to dopamine resistance. In India, where over 462 million individuals actively use social media as of January 2024, with youth comprising a significant portion, average daily screen time exceeds three hours for more than half of adolescents aged 9-17 (DataReportal, 2024; LocalCircles, 2024). This exposure correlates with attention deficits (up to 28% increased risk with &gt;3 hours daily), structural brain alterations (e.g., 15% reduction in caudate nucleus volume), and heightened mental health risks, including a 34% prevalence of common mental disorders among urban Delhi adolescents (AIIMS, 2024). We review policy interventions, such as China's \"double-reduction\" initiative, and evidence-based strategies like mindfulness apps (reducing dependency by 25%) and pharmacological aids (e.g., bupropion for dopamine reuptake inhibition). Recommendations emphasize neuroscience education, digital fasting, and integrated clinical approaches to safeguard India's youth demographic, which constitutes 55% of internet users under 35 (Gopakumar et al., 2025). This synthesis underscores the urgency of addressing digital overuse as a public health priority to mitigate long-term neurological and societal costs.",

        "authors": "Mark Carew",
        "created": "2025-10-04",
        "abstract": "A key but under-addressed driver of the health inequalities facing persons with disabilities is disability stigma. However, disability stigma remains poorly conceptualised and consequently inconsistently measured and addressed within health research. Many studies treat disability stigma and health stigma as interchangeable. However, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as the globally accepted framework for conceptualising disability clearly distinguishes between the concepts of “disability” and a “health condition”. This paper applies the ICF to show that disability stigma and health stigma have overlapping components but are conceptually distinct. Specifically, while health stigma is recognised to arise from adverse judgements about health conditions, this paper argues that disability stigma arises from adverse judgements about impairment(s), activity limitation(s), and/or health-related participation restriction(s) that may or may not relate to an individual’s health condition. This paper also explains why this distinction matters. First, it aligns the study of disability stigma with modern definitions of disability and the lived experiences persons with disabilities have of stigma. Second, it enables intersectional analysis of the impact of distinct stigmas arising from judgements about health condition(s) and disability status. Third, it contributes to better ways to measure disability stigma and consequently address it within interventions and policies. Fourth, it contributes to an improved classification of stigma within the ICF itself, which can be used to more comprehensively study health inequalities affecting persons with disabilities.",

While many studies cite it, only some make use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment Promenade, that aims to address the walkthrough method’s incoherent aims and theoretical perspective. It combines the walkthrough method’s technical walkthrough with a theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment.

While supporters embrace the movement’s messaging around healthier lifestyles and nutritional choices, critics point to its political undertones and the widespread misinformation associated with it. To better understand the dynamics of public perceptions of the MAHA movement, our study leverages sentiment classification and topic modeling to analyze discourse about the movement on X. Our analysis reveals an interesting trend: although the movement initially generated overwhelmingly positive sentiment, overall positivity declined following the nomination and subsequent confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as President Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services to the point where negative sentiment began to outweigh positive sentiments. Further integration of such trends with topic modeling analysis suggests that while the public initially supported the ideals of healthier lifestyles promoted by the MAHA movement, enthusiasm diminished and eventually turned negative once the movement became entangled with political dimensions and controversial policies.",

        "abstract": "The color of each cord is often highlighted as one of the primary sites of meaning on an Inka khipu -- the mostly undeciphered recording device of the Inka empire. However, while there are a variety of historical, ethnographic, and archaeological suggestions for how the semantics of color worked, none of these approaches systematically explains how Inka khipu cord colors denoted meaning. Instead, they present a range of fragmented, sometimes contradictory snapshots of a much larger, more complex system. This study aims to address the question: is there even a \"system\" of color that can be discovered and deciphered? If so, how did it work? Or is the sheer variety of uses discussed in prior studies an empirical indication that color had limited semiotic consistency for Inka khipukamayuqs (\"khipu makers/interpreters\" in Quechua)? To answer these questions, I employ an AI khipukamayuq -- a custom \"transformer\" deep learning model trained to parse all of the cord colors in the Open Khipu Repository (OKR) -- to analyze the semantic space of Inka khipu cord color. My findings reveal a coherent system of color signs, wherein different colors occupy distinct, relationally-opposed semantic domains, with many colors demonstrating polysemy. This suggests a versatile set of color signs adaptable to various contexts and domains of representation, akin to other linguistic media. In the domain of khipus and beyond, this study points toward the importance of continued interaction with AI models as archaeologists learn (together with machines) to systematically represent and delineate the past.",

At the syntactic level, the extended idea that complements introduced by en are direct objects is refuted, and the possibility is noted of the alternation taking place with verbs that select an indirect object as their second argument. At the semantic level, it is concluded that the structure introduced by en describes a dynamic, durative, atelic event that entails agentivity.

        "abstract": "Agroforestry adoption by smallholders globally has been limited despite long-term encouragement from national policies. In India, a dedicated agroforestry policy, combined with its potential to contribute to forest restoration goals, has led to a renewed emphasis on promoting the adoption of agroforestry practices among smallholders. However, the views of smallholders residing near forest fringes, who are often approached for adopting agroforestry as part of restoration plans, have not been extensively documented. Using surveys and interviews, we investigate the motivations for engagement and non-engagement in agroforestry for forest restoration among smallholder farmers in Chhota Udepur district, Gujarat. Our logistic regression model indicates that the results of agroforestry from fellow farmers and knowledge about government programs have a strong positive association with agroforestry engagement. In contrast, water availability and trust in government are negatively associated with engagement. Our interviews substantiate these associations and provide additional information about perceived risks. Specifically, water shortages and labour scarcity are significant barriers to smallholders considering the adoption of agroforestry. In all sampled villages, smallholders have emphasised a need for reliable markets for selling agroforestry produce. The mobilisation of sales through existing farmer producer organisations in the region presents an opportunity to increase agroforestry uptake among farmers. Additionally, we find that the impact of the national agroforestry policy has been limited; however, given smallholders’ preference for government programs, this trust can be leveraged to provide better financial and technical support. Overall, our study reinforces the finding that unless livelihoods are secured, engagement in restoration by smallholders is likely to remain limited, ultimately undermining the potential co-benefits of forest restoration to the most vulnerable.",

They founded Circle A in 2014 as the first Radical Eurodance act ever, with the self-declared mission of “making Eurodance a threat again” and framing it as “a four-to-the-floor declaration of war against any kind of injustice and oppression that haunts the world we live in.” Over the past few years, they have only occasionally performed or recorded, due to their time being taken up by kids, other bands, and a pandemic. In early 2024, they meet over a beer to revisit their joint work and think about the topics they would like to discuss at the symposium. They reminisce about when, how, and why they founded Circle A; how the band and its music developed; what the future may hold for it; how and to what ends they mixed Eurodance and politics; and what all of this has to do with their shared background in musicology. In the process, tina and Malik also engage in discussions about fundamental questions regarding the relationship between music and the political, such as: What makes music political? Who are the audiences of political music, and how do they influence musicians’ practices? What are criteria for deciding whether a piece of political music is “good,” or maybe rather: “successful”? Can (political) music change the world? If so, how and to what extent? How can the seriousness of social struggles be squared with humorous modes of artistic expression? – As the conversation unfolds, tina and Malik switch back and forth between spoken language and song. In the end, they fail to produce notes for their symposium presentation, but they certainly enjoyed the intellectually stimulating – and sometimes controversial – exchange.",

        "abstract": "This paper theorizes how platform infrastructures produce epistemic churn—a condition in which publics remain caught in unresolved cycles of interpretation. Unlike models centered on belief accuracy or convergence, epistemic churn explains how infrastructures govern not what is believed, but whether belief stabilizes at all. We argue that churn emerges from engineered turbulence—systemic interventions that modulate epistemic friction (the difficulty of reaching interpretive closure), delaying stabilization while sustaining engagement. To render churn empirically tractable, we propose a family of methods that can both test the theory and provide qualitative nuance on its mechanics. Situating churn within a broader theory of communicative governance, the paper reframes communication theory by showing how infrastructures sustain engagement by prolonging interpretive labor. Normatively, it shows how platforms govern not by silencing expression but by deferring belief formation, a subtle form of power with profound consequences for democratic life and collective agency.",

The networks were compared using a graph correlation method, and the underlying network structures were compared using ERGMs (Exponential Random Graph Models). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures.

        "abstract": "This study aims to deepen open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence International Corps through artificial intelligence methods, exploring AI's application potential and methodological value in complex warfare information environments. The core objectives address two questions: First, how can AI technologies be effectively integrated into the OSINT cycle to enhance information screening, pattern recognition, and risk prediction? Second, can AI-driven OSINT provide more forward-looking and systematic support for strategic decision-making? Methodologically, this study adopts a multidisciplinary mixed methodology, integrating text metrology, semantic network analysis, risk radar modeling, and time-series projection to form a comprehensive framework: “Data Collection → AI Processing → Risk Assessment → Timeline Analysis → Insight Output.” The research process extensively leverages multilingual datasets (English, Ukrainian, Russian) and cross-platform information sources (official, media, social networks), utilizing visualization modeling to present data and risks in multidimensional formats. Results demonstrate that AI significantly enhances the depth and breadth of information processing in OSINT analysis. It outperforms traditional methods in misinformation detection accuracy, multilingual keyword extraction efficiency, and predictive power for risk patterns. Military risks and information warfare risks were assessed as highest priority, followed by public opinion risks and legal risks, revealing an overall “military-information warfare-public opinion” triple-high-risk configuration. Concurrently, time-series analysis revealed rhythmic patterns in risk evolution, providing quantitative foundations for future strategic planning. The study concludes that AI not only transforms OSINT's technical framework but also propels it toward structured, systematic, and forward-looking intelligence generation. AI-driven OSINT effectively bridges the tension between data fragmentation and systematic strategic analysis, enabling a qualitative leap in the intelligence cycle from “information accumulation” to “strategic insight.” This study provides an empirical paradigm for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and intelligence studies, holding significant theoretical and practical implications for future military conflicts, national security, and policy formulation.",

        "abstract": "Bibliometrics professionals are crucial in universities and research institutions, supporting research analytics, evaluation, and strategic decisions. Despite their importance, many lack formal training or access to professional networks, often relying on self-taught methods that can lead to the misuse of metrics and indicators. This limits the usefulness of bibliometric data and raises concerns about research integrity, particularly in citation practices. A global survey within the Library and Information Science (LIS) community explored training experiences, gaps, and interests, especially around research integrity. The results revealed critical knowledge gaps, including the need for a deeper understanding of bibliometric principles, responsible metrics use, advanced analysis techniques, and awareness of indicators' limitations and biases. Highlighting these deficiencies aims to engage the STI indicators community, prompting collective action to better equip bibliometrics practitioners. Proper training is essential to prevent the misuse of indicators, which can undermine research quality and academic evaluation.",
