        "abstract": "Elections are a primary mechanism through which citizens can hold politicians accountable for misconduct. However, whether voters actually punish corruption at the ballot box remains an open question, as electoral decisions often involve strategic considerations, including beliefs about how others think and behave. To better understand how such strategic considerations operate in this context, we conducted a pre-registered information intervention during a major political corruption scandal in Japan. The treatment provided information about the prevailing social norm—specifically, the perceived social intolerance of the scandal. The treatment increased turnout and support for a challenger, particularly among swing voters who initially believed that others were intolerant of corruption. Among party loyalists with more lenient prior beliefs, the same information backfired, increasing support for the incumbent. The turnout effect among swing voters was sizable—approximately six percentage points—comparable in magnitude to benchmark mobilization interventions involving personalized contact or social pressure. To account for these patterns, we develop a simple model that incorporates mechanisms—notably *moral reinforcement* and *identity reinforcement*—that generate predictions consistent with the observed heterogeneity in responses. By highlighting how perceptions of prevailing norms shape voter behavior in the presence of strategic considerations, this study contributes to a broader understanding of how democratic institutions can remain resilient in the face of political misconduct.",

        "authors": "Maijunxian Wang",
        "created": "2025-06-23",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of systemic forgiveness—a structural tendency to absolve systems, institutions, and algorithms from responsibility while punishing individuals. Drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks from political theory, sociology, and science and technology studies, the paper identifies three key mechanisms that enable this moral asymmetry: the complexity shield, attribution bias, and de-agentified narratives. Through case studies in finance, healthcare, algorithmic governance, and infrastructure, it demonstrates how systemic actors evade accountability via abstraction, opacity, and narrative displacement, while frontline workers become scapegoats. The genealogy of this phenomenon is traced from bureaucratic hierarchies to algorithmic impunity, revealing how moral responsibility has been reframed as technical failure. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for symmetrical accountability—introducing legal personhood for systems, auditable responsibility chains, reparative indexing, and epistemologically accountable design. Ultimately, it argues that systemic forgiveness is not an ethical oversight but a political logic that must be challenged in pursuit of structural justice.",

        "abstract": "Background: The possibility of widespread political violence poses a serious concern for the United States. A nationally representative survey found in 2022 that “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) Republicans, as defined, were more supportive than others of political violence. This study updates and expands those findings; the principal comparison is between MAGA Republicans and non-MAGA non-Republicans. Methods: Findings are from Wave 3 of a nationally representative annual longitudinal survey of members of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, conducted May 23-June 14, 2024. All respondents to prior waves who remained in KnowledgePanel were invited to participate. Political party and MAGA affiliations were reported by respondents. Outcomes are expressed as weighted proportions and adjusted prevalence differences (aPDs; these are percentage point (pp) differences), with p-values adjusted for the false discovery rate and reported as q-values. Results: The completion rate was 88.4%; there were 8896 respondents. After weighting, half the sample was female (50.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 49.5%, 52.3%); the weighted mean (SD) age was 48.5 (24.9) years. MAGA Republicans were substantially more likely than non-MAGA non-Republicans to endorse violence to effect sociopolitical change generally and to consider violence usually or always justified to advance at least 1 of 21 specific political objectives (MAGA Republicans, 55.9% (95% CI 52.3%, 59.4%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 25.5% (95% CI 23.7%, 27.2%); aPD 30.1pp (95% CI 26.0pp, 34.2pp), q &lt; 0.001). They were not more willing to commit political violence. Similarly, while MAGA Republicans more frequently predicted that they would be armed in a future setting where they considered political violence to be justified (very or extremely likely: MAGA Republicans, 19.8% (95% CI 17.0%, 22.6%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 5.5% (95% CI 4.6%, 6.4%); aPD 16.4pp (95% CI 13.3pp, 19.5pp), q &lt; 0.001), they were not more likely to shoot someone (very or extremely likely: MAGA Republicans, 2.1% (95% CI 0.8%, 3.4%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 1.6% (95% CI 1.0%, 2.1%); aPD 1.5pp (95% CI -0.1pp, 3.0pp), q = 0.43). Prevalences for other Republicans generally fell between those for MAGA Republicans and non-MAGA non-Republicans. On some political violence measures, prevalences were highest among a small, demographically distinct group of non-Republican MAGA supporters. In secondary analyses, MAGA Republicans endorsed statements of beliefs associated with political violence—racism, hostile sexism, homonegativity, transphobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia; support for the QAnon movement and Christian nationalism; conspiracism; trait aggression; and authoritarianism—more frequently than did non-MAGA non-Republicans. Conclusions: In 2024, MAGA Republicans were more likely than others to endorse political violence and beliefs associated with an increased risk of committing violence. They were not more willing to commit political violence themselves, but their endorsement may increase the risk that political violence will occur.",

        "abstract": "Foreign donors routinely use nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to deliver aid abroad. However, recent decades have witnessed a global cascade of restrictive anti-NGO legislation. How have foreign aid donors responded and adapted to this legal crackdown on NGOs? Using original data from all countries that received aid from 1981–2012, we assess the impact of anti-NGO laws on total flows of official foreign aid, the nature of projects funded, and the channels used for distributing this aid. Overall, we find that donors scale back their operations in repressive countries. However, rather than completely withdraw, we also find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries by decreasing funds for politically sensitive issues in favor of regime-compatible causes. Donors also channel more aid through domestic rather than foreign NGOs; however, this change is by no means a perfect substitute. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for official aid donors, INGOs, and local groups working on contentious causes such as elections, human rights, media, corruption, and advocacy.",

        "abstract": "Social media platforms can be effective tools for mainstreaming and transnationalization of radical positions. Anti-gender ideas have particularly gained traction transnationally in recent years. Despite extensive research on the anti-gender movement, the specific role of social media remains underexplored. How do anti-gender organizations use social media to strategically mainstream and transnationalize their agenda? This study addresses this overarching question by focusing on CitizenGO, a digital advocacy organization that holds a key position within the anti-gender transnational advocacy network. We examine its multilingual social media network and activities over a decade (2013-2022) using computational and digital methods. The findings indicate that CitizenGO uses a sophisticated network of social media accounts to coordinate and amplify anti-gender messages across different languages and regions. The study suggests that CitizenGO’s strategic use of social media is aimed at mainstreaming and globalizing anti-gender agendas, contributing new insights into the mechanisms of digital advocacy and the transnational expansion of anti-gender networks.",

        "abstract": "Disinformation has become an increasing concern for European policymakers and the broader public, raising pressing questions about safeguarding political discourse and institutional trust in an evolving digital landscape. This focus paper begins by mapping the current landscape of disinformation policies within the European Union, including public and private regulatory approaches. While significant efforts have been made— particularly in targeting foreign information manipulation—we argue that existing policy frameworks overlook important aspects of how disinformation works. Above all, there is a lack of attention to the issue of credibility: how individuals determine whether information is trustworthy and what role identity cues play in their assessments. To address this gap, we conducted a survey experiment to understand how young people evaluate the credibility of online content. The experiment involved 152 university students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Respondents were sorted into different groups based on their self-identified gender and country of origin at the beginning of the survey. They were then asked to assess the credibility of a series of social media posts covering a range of topics. Finally, respondents were invited to reflect in writing on the reasons behind their evaluations, allowing us to compare quantitative trust ratings with qualitative reasoning. Our findings confirm that content quality remains the strongest predictor of perceived credibility. However, they also reveal that subtle identity cues—such as a shared gender or national background between the respondent and the post’s author—exert a small but consistent influence on trust evaluations. These effects often occur below the level of conscious awareness, suggesting that social proximity and identity alignment can shape how people perceive truth, even when they believe they are evaluating content objectively. Notably, the results also challenge some common assumptions: posts from authors with Anglo-American names, often associated with epistemic authority, were not rated as more credible, and male-presenting sources were not favored over female-presenting ones. Taken together, our findings underline that perceived credibility of information is not a fixed quality but shaped by content, identity, and situational cues. Disinformation policies may therefore fall short if they do not account for these more subjective dynamics of trust.",

        "abstract": "This paper outlines the construction of high-resolution, 7-digit product-level Supply-Use Tables (SUTs) and symmetric Input-Output Tables (IOTs) for the Indian economy, leveraging microdata from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for the period 2016-2022. We delineate a robust methodology encompassing the generation of detailed input and output flows, with a particular focus on the reconciliation of data from registered and unregistered manufacturing sectors through a meticulously developed NPCMS-NIC concordance. The critical transformation from the often-rectangular SUTs to square, symmetric product-by-product IOTs is explicated using the Industry Technology Assumption, a choice justified by its suitability for handling by-products prevalent in a diverse manufacturing landscape. The analytical prowess of this newly constructed high-resolution IOT framework is then demonstrated through its application to assess key economic impacts, specifically the Domestic Value Added (DVA) generated and the employment supported by production and export activities. A detailed case study of India’s rapidly evolving mobile phone manufacturing sector (NPCMS 4722200) for the 2016-2022 period reveals profound structural shifts: significant output growth coupled with notable import substitution, a remarkable surge in exports, and a dynamic evolution in the DVA versus Foreign Value Added (FVA) shares, particularly in export-oriented production. The analysis further uncovers substantial employment growth, albeit with an increasing reliance on contractual labour and a heartening rise in female participation in the workforce. These meticulously constructed tables represent a significant methodological advancement and provide an invaluable empirical resource for nuanced analysis of sectoral interdependencies, the efficacy of industrial policy, and the complex dynamics of India’s engagement with global value chains.",

        "abstract": "El agravamiento de las problemáticas ambientales, sociales y económicas asociadas al uso de combustibles fósiles intensifica la urgencia de una transición hacia fuentes de energía renovables, impulsando la adopción de tecnologías como paneles solares, turbinas eólicas y vehículos eléctricos. Aunque frecuentemente promovidas como soluciones sostenibles, estas tecnologías presentan características intrínsecas - como menor densidad energética, vida útil reducida y limitaciones en los procesos de reciclaje - que incrementan la dependencia de minerales, muchos de ellos clasificados como “críticos”. Este artículo busca contribuir al debate mediante el análisis de los impactos del aumento significativo en la demanda de estos recursos. Con base en la definición de minerales críticos de la Agencia Internacional de Energías Renovables - que incluye cobalto, níquel, cobre, litio y metales de tierras raras -, se realizó una amplia recopilación, sistematización y análisis de datos a escala global, identificando los principales países productores y los contextos socioambientales asociados a su extracción. Los resultados evidencian la reproducción de un patrón histórico: la mayor parte de estos minerales se extrae en países del Sur Global, especialmente en África, Asia y América Latina, donde las normativas ambientales, sociales y económicas tienden a ser más flexibles, favoreciendo a grandes corporaciones transnacionales. Se constató, además, que la extracción de estos minerales suele estar asociada a impactos socioambientales graves, como contaminación intensa, exposición de trabajadores a metales tóxicos y financiamiento de milicias vinculadas a regímenes autoritarios. Estas cuestiones, aún poco discutidas en el discurso dominante sobre la temática, requieren una mayor atención por parte de la comunidad científica y de la sociedad en general, a fin de promover una transición energética verdaderamente justa a escala global.",

        "created": "2025-06-20",
        "abstract": "The so-called Cobb–Douglas production function offers a synthetic mathematical formalization of economic activity. Focused primarily on capital and labor, it systematically overlooks the role of natural resources and the environment—an omission that has made it the target of recurring criticism. To examine the validity of these critiques, this article proposes a parallel with Kleiber’s law in biology, which links an organism’s energy consumption to its body mass through the notion of basal metabolic rate. We demonstrate that this analogy opens the way for a reinterpretation of both the Cobb–Douglas function and the Solow model, enabling a perspective that is not only compatible with but also complementary to ecological economics. Moreover, it reveals a deeper homology: in both cases, the functions describe the behavior of dissipative thermodynamic systems, which organize energy flows to sustain their structural integrity. This framework allows for a physical reading of economic production mechanisms—not as abstract aggregates, but as expressions of a universal process of self-organization driven by flows of matter and energy. It enables the integration of thermodynamic constraints into the core of economic theory, in continuity with existing literature, while paving the way for an understanding of the economy as a physically evolving system",

        "abstract": "How does basic income (a regular, unconditional, guaranteed cash transfer) impact labor supply? We show that in search models of the labor market with income effects, this impact is theoretically ambiguous: Employment and job durations might increase or decrease, match surplus might be shifted to workers or employers, and worker surplus might be reallocated between wages and job amenities. We thus turn to empirical evidence to study this impact. We conducted a pre-registered RCT in Germany, starting 2021, where recipients received 1200 Euro/month for three years. We draw on both administrative and survey data, and find no extensive margin (employment) response, and no impact on job transitions from either non-employment or employment. We do find a small statistically insignificant intensive margin shift to part-time employment, which implies an excess burden (reduction of government revenues) of ca 7.5% of the transfer. We furthermore observe a small increase of enrollment in training or education. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

Then we show that capitals locate closer to each other when they have more of these types of geography between them. Finally, we show that city pairs are less likely to belong to the same state if they have more of this geography between them, allowing us to use geography to predict the territorial size and shape of Europe’s Great Powers.

        "authors": "Lucy Císař Brown",
        "created": "2025-06-20",
        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to theoretically reassess Weber’s concept of ‘disenchantment through rationalisation’, as primarily laid out in Science as a Vocation (1917) and The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1946), to propose that recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are repositioning humans into a state of ‘technological re-enchantment’. This process of re-enchantment acknowledges both the fundamentally dialectical nature of Weber's disenchantment and recognises that contemporary AI development has created systems whose operational logic exceeds human comprehension while remaining indispensable for achieving complex objectives. This paper therefore makes two theoretical contributions: first, it demonstrates that Weber's concept of rationalisation contains structural possibilities for re-enchantment that emerge through, rather than despite, formal rational processes; second, it argues that artificial intelligence represents the first empirical instantiation of this theoretical possibility, requiring us to reconceptualise the relationship between rationalisation and epistemic authority. 'Technological re-enchantment' here refers not to the return of pre-modern consciousness but to the emergence of structural epistemic dependence that operates through rational processes. Unlike traditional forms of authority based on tradition, charisma, or bureaucratic position, AI-mediated authority rests on demonstrated performance in contexts where explanatory understanding is structurally impossible. The concept will therefore be explored through three stages: first, examining the dialectical structure of Weber's disenchantment theory; second, analysing how AI's architecture creates unprecedented epistemic dependence; and finally, demonstrating how this represents re-enchantment through, rather than despite, rational processes.",

        "abstract": "Scholarly publishing takes place in an institutional arena that is opaque to its practitioners. As readers, writers, reviewers, and editors, we have no clear view of the system within which we’re working. Researchers starting their careers receive (if they’re lucky) folk wisdom and mythology handed down from advisor to advisee, geared more toward individual success (or survival) than toward attaining a systemic perspective. They may learn how to get their work into the right journals or books, but often don’t learn why that is the outcome that matters for their careers, how the field arrived at that decision, and what the alternatives are – or should be. Gaining a wider perspective is important both for shaping individual careers and for confronting the systematic problems we face as a community of knowledge creators and purveyors. This primer starts from the premise that sociologists, especially those early in their careers, need to learn about the system of scholarly communication. And that sociology can help us toward that goal. Understanding the political economy of the system within which publication takes place is necessary for us to fulfill our roles as citizens of the research community, as people who play an active role in shaping the future of that system, consciously or not. Responsible citizenship requires learning about the institutional actors in the system and how they are governed, as well as who pays and who profits within the field, and who wins or loses.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into tools that assist with systematic literature reviews, yet few empirical evaluations exist on their effectiveness for abstract screening—particularly within social science domains. This study evaluates the performance and cost of three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o Mini) in classifying relevance of abstracts in a real-world literature review on “net widening” and diversion programs in the criminal justice system. Using a batch inference pipeline, we tested models with both short and long prompt formats, assessing classification accuracy, precision, recall, and cost in 2024 USD. Our results show that while accuracy and recall were relatively high across all models (up to 90% accuracy and 95% recall), precision was lower—particularly for GPT-3.5 with long prompts—suggesting that while LLMs can support abstract screening, they are not yet a substitute for trained human reviewers in high-stakes systematic reviews. Notably, the low-cost GPT-4o Mini achieved near-parity in performance with GPT-4 Turbo, indicating promising potential for rapid, exploratory review workflows. This paper offers practical benchmarks, cost analyses, and recommendations for integrating LLMs into evidence review pipelines, emphasizing the need for thoughtful, transparent use of these tools in academic research.",

        "abstract": "Resilience has become a prominent concept in EU social and economic policy, positioned as a response to megatrends such as technological change, labour market deregulation and demographic shifts. This article critically examines how resilience is conceptualised in EU policy, arguing that it insufficiently accounts for structural inequalities in individuals’ capacities to adapt to risks. Building on cumulative inequality theory and the prevalences and penalties framework, we propose an “inequalities in resilience” framework that distinguishes between the need for resilience—measured by exposure to labour market risks—and the capacity for resilience—measured by the ability to avoid poverty when risks materialise. Using EI-SILC data for 30 countries, 2010–2020, encompassing 3,103,097 individuals, we find that groups with greater need for resilience, particularly those with lower educational attainment and single-parent households, show lower capacity for resilience. This pattern shows a high degree of consistency across different risks and poverty indicators, and national contexts. We conclude that resilience-focused policy must integrate prevention and resource-based interventions while recognising the compounded, path-dependent, and status-based nature of inequality. Addressing these layered disadvantages requires coordinated, inclusive policy designs that go beyond individual adaptation to tackle the structural roots of disadvantage.",

Background: Grandparents are important providers of childcare for their children's families, but they may face competing caregiving demands within the family, especially as spousal caregivers. Limited resources may force them to prioritize one family member over another, particularly when new care needs emerge. Method: This study used eight waves (2004–2022) of data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, covering 19 countries. The sample included individuals aged 50+ who had participated in at least two study waves and had a grandchild under age 13 (56,383 observations from 18,754 respondents). Asymmetric fixed-effects regression was employed to examine whether starting or stopping spousal care was associated with changes in grandchild care frequency. Results: Starting intensive spousal care was associated with reduced grandchild care frequency, similarly for grandfathers and grandmothers. The results also indicated a negative effect of stopping spousal care on childcare, particularly among grandfathers, although this finding was not statistically significant. Further inspection revealed that stopping spousal care was associated with reduced grandchild care only among grandfathers who no longer resided with their partner (e.g., due to institutionalization or death). Conclusion: Engagement in intensive spousal care predicts grandparental childcare, showing that intensifying resource competition impacts the distribution of care within families.",

        "abstract": "Attendance at religious services is a consistent predictor of positive mental health outcomes, though our findings suggest this may not hold for all racial-ethnic groups. Using data from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study (N = 57,754), this study examines how the relationship between religious attendance and self-rated mental health varies across racial-ethnic groups in the United States, with a focus on Asian Americans. Findings reveal that religious attendance is significantly associated with better mental health for White, Black, and Hispanic Americans, but not for Asian Americans. The positive association is strongest for Blacks, followed by Whites and Hispanics, while Asians show no significant relationship. We suggest that the dual-minority status of religious Asian Americans (as religious minorities within their co-ethnic group, and ethnic minorities in their religious group) could potentially underlie this null association. Findings highlight the importance of considering racial-ethnic differences when studying the mental health benefits of religious participation.",

        "authors": "AMALIA ALI",
        "created": "2025-05-30",
        "abstract": "In the United States, Black women are dying at alarming rates compared to their white counterparts, during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Public health researchers and practitioners are attempting to close this disparity gap and improve maternal health outcomes for Black women. This paper will examine the Black maternal crisis in the context of the United States, following a bioethical framework, Black Bioethics, that interrogates the racialized encounters with the US healthcare system and acknowledges the unique experiences of Black women as they navigate this system. I argue that the Black maternal crisis is a continuation of racial logics that emerged in the epoch of American Slavery and persists in contemporary obstetrics in the form of medicalization. Established as a medical specialty in the 19th century, obstetrics and gynecology inherited the practices that marked the reproductive capacities of enslaved Black women as inherently different and justified experimentation and interventions that produced fatal outcomes for the mother and child. Black bioethics provides a framework for interrogating this history and engaging with the narratives of Black mothers as a basis for humanizing maternal care that has shown promising results in mitigating the Black maternal crisis. Drawing on interviews with researchers, professionals, and Black women, from the practicum experience, the paper outlines alternative models of care that are inspired by the narratives of resistance and proposes an education-based framework to address gaps in professional understandings. It is the aim of this paper to introduce an ethical framework that bridges history, public health research, and current initiatives to understand the impact of medicalization on the Black maternal crisis.",

While large-scale crises, including pandemics, have sometimes disrupted entrenched economic hierarchies and reduced inequality by shaking the foundations of power and privilege (Scheidel 2017), the COVID-19 crisis stands in contrast to this pattern, with inequality patterns more in line with recent economic recessions (Couch and Fairlie 2010; Couch, R. Fairlie, and Xu 2018; Couch, R. W. Fairlie, and Xu 2020; Hoynes 1999). Workers in low-wage sectors, such as hospitality, retail, and other service industries, who are disproportionately from racial minority groups and less likely to hold a college degree, faced high levels of job insecurity. In contrast, workers in high-skilled occupations, particularly those able to work remotely, were better positioned to weather the economic storm, highlighting the role of educational attainment as a key factor in mitigating labor market disruptions (Acemoglu 2002; Angelucci, Manuela, Marco Angrisani, Daniel M Bennett, Arie Kapteyn, and Simone G Schaner. 2020; Grusky et al. 2021; Montenovo et al. 2022). The sudden economic downturn and unprecedented labor market conditions triggered by COVID- 19 provide a unique backdrop to reassess the utility of college degrees under crisis conditions and explore whether the effects of having college degrees vary across different subsets of workers.",

Using RTD as both method and critique, we treat intellectual property (IP) law and commodification not as neutral structures but as epistemic simulations—design artifacts that encode power, erase referents, and reify hallucination as value. Drawing on Baudrillard’s theory of simulation, Monett and Paquet’s critique of automated epistemologies, and emerging jurisprudence around AI authorship, we introduce the concept of juridical referentiality to describe how law increasingly mirrors the ungrounded patterns of generative systems. The law, like AI, now performs alignment—simulating authorship, creativity, and consent through recursive abstraction. Through a reflexive RTD lens, we interrogate these patterns and propose alternatives grounded in epistemic pluralism, regenerative authorship, and friction-led design. The paper culminates in a hybrid framework—bridging design and legal governance—that resists epistemic enclosure and restores referential integrity in a world governed by simulation.",

These themes address existential needs, foster belonging, facilitate emotional release and regulation, and promote personal growth – ultimately enhancing connection, mastery, and self-regulation in individuals with major depressive disorder outpatients. The study uniquely highlights the therapeutic roles of sensory stimuli and exhaustion/catharsis, while confirming the importance of social interaction and autonomy.

        "abstract": "While many studies of public opinion in authoritarian regimes rely on list experiments to overcome sensitivity bias, we show in this paper that a different technique, the crosswise variant of the randomized response design, has superior performance at measuring latent opposition to authoritarian regimes with fewer assumptions. To show the power of this design, we randomly assigned a panel of 924 Tunisian survey respondents to receive either a direct question about support for Tunisian President Kais Saied or a randomized response question. Our results reveal that between 10% to 30% of Tunisians oppose the president but would not report this opposition on a direct question. We further employed a Bayesian parameterization of the randomized response design to decompose the sensitivity bias and model latent opposition and bias as a function of survey covariates. We find that ideological and policy disagreement with the president strongly predicts latent opposition, but that these same measures are negatively related to sensitivity bias. As a result, we show that respondents who are ideologically closer to the president--that is, the moderate opposition--tend to be more afraid of reporting their resistance to the regime than the more radical opposition.",

Data from the 2023–2024 Healthy Minds Study, a nationally representative survey of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in the United States, were analyzed. Survey-weighted regression models were used to assess gender differences and the association between financial stress and anxiety. A generalized structural equation model (GSEM) tested whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Financial stress was modeled as a continuous predictor, anxiety as a continuous mediator, and academic disruption as an ordinal outcome. Female students reported significantly higher levels of financial stress and anxiety than male students, even after adjusting for age and race. Financial stress was positively associated with anxiety for both male and female students. This indicates a broad impact of financial pressure on emotional well-being. Anxiety subsequently predicted academic disruption. Mediation analysis revealed that anxiety significantly mediated the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption, and this explained more than half of the total effect. These findings highlight anxiety as a key psychological pathway through which financial stress affects academic functioning. Interventions targeting financial stress may improve both emotional well-being and academic performance, particularly for students facing elevated financial and psychological vulnerability.",

        "abstract": "Mass media is widely used to engage audiences with the natural world. Given their extensive reach and attention to ecological topics, there has been growing interest in using commercial video games for conservation outreach. However, there has not yet been a holistic overview of work on this topic. We produced the first systematic map on how commercial video games engage with biodiversity and conservation. This includes 380 papers, covering five languages as well as both empirical (34.7%) and non-empirical (65.3%) literature. Our manuscript is complemented by a freely accessible and fully interactive online database. Users can further explore our findings and interrogate the available evidence according to their own interests. Overall, the field is even more diverse and multidisciplinary than expected: 450 different games have been studied, and a variety of ways to depict or engage with real-world ecology have been scrutinised. Ecocriticism dominates non-empirical work – often evaluating the extent that game design encourages or condemns exploitation of nature. Empirical papers are overwhelmingly non-experimental (93.7%); research has most often explored how video games represent real-world wildlife, influence players’ ecological perceptions, or inform players’ interactions with virtual nature. Despite the volume of literature, there are glaring omissions. Few studies employed pre/post-test assessments or even control groups, therefore making it difficult to infer the causal effects of video games. Most notably, there is not yet evidence on whether games make players more or less likely to take real-world pro-ecological action. Video games clearly have the potential to represent biodiversity and convey ecological messages – whether these be helpful or harmful for conservation. However, only by taking more rigorous approaches can we better understand the impact of games for this purpose. Our map highlights several promising areas for future study. As examples, we strongly recommend that researchers consider the role of player differences on the impact of games, observe actual behaviours and how these change after play, and pursue interdisciplinary collaborations with the games industry for more thorough, applicable, and novel findings.",

        "abstract": "This article undertakes a comparative exploration of Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory and Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory (ANT) in the context of poverty research. Drawing on various empirical studies derived from a larger qualitative project—based on 216 in-depth interviews with long-term poor households—it examines how each framework accounts for capital conversion, constrained agency, and the reproduction of structural exclusion. Although both theorists promote relational and anti-essentialist perspectives, they differ markedly in ontological orientation and analytic focus. Bourdieu highlights the structuring effects of fields, habitus, and symbolic violence, while Latour centres on translation, mediation, and the generative power of heterogeneous networks. Through four thematic case studies—debt, welfare bureaucracy, neighbourhood stigma, and the informal economy—the analysis demonstrates that each framework reveals distinct yet complementary dimensions of poverty. Whereas Bourdieu offers powerful tools to explain the institutional reproduction of inequality, Latour draws attention to the situated agency of actors navigating complex material and social assemblages. The article argues for a relational synthesis that acknowledges both enduring field structures and contingent actor-networks. It concludes that poverty persists not through structure or contingency alone, but through the recursive entanglement of both.",

One of these strategies is to make text data sharing a more common practice in the field -- which would also greatly enhance reproducibility of research. In this article, we outline three avenues to share as much of your data as possible, while still honouring ethical and legal restrictions. Given the relative lack of infrastructure for some of these avenues, we also highlight the capacities of the Amsterdam Content Analysis Toolkit (AmCAT) to enable non standard sharing strategies.

        "abstract": "The emergence of decentralized science (DeSci) and the potential for its acceleration through artificial intelligence (AI) presents both remarkable promise and formidable challenges for modern research. DeSci AI platforms use blockchain-based, openly governed workflows and autonomous AI “swarms” capable of literature synthesis, peer-review triage, and reputation tracking to democratize access, speed discovery, and rebuild public trust. Yet, they also introduce complex implementation barriers and governance questions. The transformative claims of DeSci must be gauged against the benchmark of conventional science. Traditional research practice is anchored in methodological rigor through hypothesis-driven design, validated instrumentation, standard operating protocols, and independent peer review. Stable institutional arrangements such as universities, funding councils, and archival journals further buttress reliability by providing clear governance and normative oversight. Nevertheless, the contemporary academic reward economy, in which publication is highly valued, and grant income constitute the currency of promotion, often favors projects with near-certain, publishable outcomes. This frequently suppresses genuine curiosity, leaving potentially transformative inquiries chronically underexplored. The scientific community must therefore embrace decentralized, data-secure alternatives while preserving valuable institutional frameworks. Successful adoption of DeSci-AI hinges on interrelated technical, cultural, regulatory, and resource-related challenges. This perspective maps those barriers and proposes integrated strategies including token-backed reviewer remuneration, incentive pools for negative or replication studies, AI-driven misconduct auditors, and hybrid governance pilots, to chart a realistic pathway for the scientific community to leverage DeSci AI synergies while safeguarding rigor, equity, and societal trust.",

        "abstract": "The Creative Health Review (CHR) published in 2023 is an advocacy document by the UK National Centre for Creative Health and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Arts, Health and Wellbeing. The CHR defines creative health activities as visual and performing arts, crafts, film, literature, cooking, gardening, and visits to cultural centres and heritage sites and claims that active promotion of such activities in socially disadvantaged communities and among marginalised groups can mitigate health inequalities. The report relies on case studies and testimonies of lived experiences as primary sources of evidence. Our critical reflections on methods and content show that the CHR is insufficient to substantiate its claims. Instead, it fails to acknowledge the need to adhere to established frameworks of critical appraisal and evidence synthesis. In conclusion, the CHR does not provide a foundation for evidence-based public health policies and practice to address health inequalities through culture and the arts.",

        "abstract": "Wealth inequality results from stratified access to accumulation opportunities, relating to differences in income, financial behavior, and transfers. Yet, it remains unclear whether these wealth accumulation channels differ in their perceived relevance for women and men along the wealth distribution. A deeper understanding of such perceptions is crucial for explaining attitudes toward inequality, shaping policy legitimacy, and uncovering the narratives that sustain or challenge the economic status quo. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP; waves 2017 and 2019), we compare the self-assessed relevance of eight different accumulation channels. Regression models (N=23,857) reveal that dependent employment is widely perceived as relevant for wealth accumulation across the wealth distribution, particularly for men. Individuals in higher wealth quartiles attribute a greater relevance to a broader range of accumulation channels. Women perceive marriage as more important for accumulating wealth, regardless of how wealthy they are. Women in the top wealth quartile perceive financial transfers as contributing more to their wealth than men do. These findings suggest that women ascribe a higher relevance to relational and dependent channels, while men emphasize the relevance of self-generated wealth. This reflects persistent gender-segregated economic structures that continue to reinforce the gender wealth gap.",

        "abstract": "The social media platform TikTok has surged in societal and political significance, underscoring the need for communication researchers to study its content and dynamics. `traktok` is an `R` package that combines an implementation of the TikTok Research API with access to TikTok content through web-scraping and the 'hidden' API, which was reverse engineered to grant users access to more content. While it is neither the first nor only tool to do so, the combination both ways to retrieve data from the platform with an easy-to-understand consistent syntax is built to encourage TikTok research.",

        "authors": "Rodrigo Alonso Reyes Cordova, peter achterberg",
        "created": "2025-06-22",
        "abstract": "This study examines the political polarization of public trust in science across Europe, focusing on the roles of motivated reasoning and political partisanship. We distinguish between impact science, which often entails regulatory constraints on industrial activity, and production science, which supports technological and economic development. While prior research has largely centered on the U.S., European data reveal similar ideological patterns: left-leaning individuals exhibit greater trust in science overall, and particularly in impact science, while right-leaning individuals show greater trust in production science. These findings suggest that the politicization of science is domain-specific. We find evidence for both motivated reasoning and partisanship as drivers of science polarization. Education amplifies ideological differences in trust toward impact science, consistent with motivated reasoning, while closeness to a particular political party amplifies ideological differences in trust toward science in general and impact science, highlighting the role of partisanship. Exploratory path analysis indicates that partisanship exerts a greater influence than education. Our findings underscore that polarization is most pronounced in scientific disciplines and claims that challenge industrial interests and align with social welfare goals, and that partisanship plays a central role in shaping public trust in this scientific domain.",

        "authors": "Tyler J Lane",
        "created": "2025-06-20",
        "abstract": "Background: There is considerable debate about whether the unprecedented rise in violence experienced across the United States in 2020 was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police. This study aimed to add clarity by analysing violent crime data in Minneapolis. Methods: Interrupted time series on daily occurrences/counts of homicide, aggravated assault, domestic assault, sex offenses, detected gunfire, and 911 calls from 2019-2021 in Minneapolis. Models included logistic and quasi-Poisson regressions, adjusting for weekend, holidays, and maximum daily temperature. Results: Reported violent events did not increase during the pandemic, while incidence of sex offenses decreased 18% (95%CI: 0.71-0.93) and 911 calls by 3% (95%CI: 0.96-0.98). After Floyd’s murder, homicide increased 137% (95%CI: 1.10-5.11), aggravated assaults by 43% (95%CI: 1.23-1.66), sex offenses by 35% (95%CI: 1.05-1.74), and gunfire by 108% (95%CI: 1.81-2.40), while 911 calls decreased 5% (95%CI: 0.92-0.97). Conclusions: Floyd’s murder better explains the 2020 rise in violence. The immediate rise in gunfire after Floyd’s murder suggests a change in the willingness to use firearms already in possession rather than a sudden influx of them, while the drop in 911 calls aligns with the theory that the causative mechanism was community members disengaging from police to address crime and resolved disputes.",
