        "created": "2025-05-26",
        "abstract": "This article describes the evolution of the discussion around the concept of path dependence, which has established itself as an explanatory framework in various academic disciplines, including policy research. It outlines the diversity of conceptual ideas, presents efforts at specification that have helped to further multiply the interpretive possibilities of the concept, and illustrates the application of the concept in social and environmental policy. In the two policy fields, the concept is significant for the scientific debate in different ways, which indicates that the meaning of concepts is shaped by the respective discussion environment. The article shows that the ambiguity of the concept has not hindered its further application. There are now many different plausible reference points for dealing with the concept of path dependence in policy research.",

        "created": "2025-05-25",
        "abstract": "Previous conflict forecasting efforts identified three areas for improvement: the importance of spatiotemporal dependencies and nonlinearities and the further exploitation of latent information in conflict variables, a lack of interpretability in return for high accuracy of complex algorithms, and the need to quantify prediction uncertainty. We predict conflict fatalities with temporal fusion transformers which have several desirable features for forecasting, addressing all these points. First, they can produce multi-horizon forecasts and probabilistic predictions, offering a flexible and nonparametric approach. Second, they can incorporate time-invariant covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series which allows to identify globally important variables, persistent temporal patterns, and significant events. Third, this approach puts a strong focus on interpretability so that we can investigate temporal dynamics more thoroughly. Our approach outperforms benchmarks from an award-winning early warning system over several metrics and test windows and is a valuable addition to the forecaster's toolkit.",

        "abstract": "What do economists do in central banks? Why do central banks hire economists? This book investigates the evolving role of economists and economic knowledge within central banks, arguing that their current centrality is neither self-evident nor historically inevitable. While the presence and influence of economists in central banks today may seem natural, this book shows that it is the result of a complex, gradual, and uneven historical process shaped by institutional structures, disciplinary transformations, and shifting relationships between science and policy. Drawing on a rich but dispersed body of literature, the book traces how economists progressively gained authority through the establishment of statistics departments, the adoption of macroeconometric models, and the emergence of a shared cognitive infrastructure between academia and central banks. Rather than focusing on individuals or doctrines, it examines general trends and institutional shifts across a series of national case studies to show how central banks function as boundary organizations, at the intersection of policy and science.",

        "abstract": "It has been well-established that central bank policy agendas are shaped by the spread of ideas, individual governors’ agency and economic and political pressures. However, in the case of the European Central Bank (ECB) the influence of the multi-level set-up of the Eurosystem consisting of both the ECB and National Central Banks (NCBs) is often not considered. How does this peculiar institutional setup shape the agenda? This study argues that NCBs act as intermediaries, channeling national and public priorities to the ECB level. Using a transformer model, alongside sequence and cross-sectional time-series analyses of ECB and NCB speeches from 1997 to 2024, I find that the ECB agenda and issue-responsiveness vis-a-vis `new' topics are driven primarily by NCBs. By revealing how NCBs shape what and when the ECB talks about certain topics, I also contribute more broadly to implications of the multi-level structure of the EU as well as how independent central banks and international organisations respond to outside pressures.",

        "abstract": "The article raises the question of the existence of fundamental identity and difference between the totalitarian regimes of fascism/Nazism and communism with a discussion on their status in the first period of post-Soviet political transit. The main arguments in favor of identifying both types of totalitarianism and fundamental moments of distinction were reflected in the correspondence controversy of A. Besançon and L. Kołakowski. Criticism of the totalitarianism of fascist and communist types in the works of the French philosopher of Greek origin Cornelius Castoriadis allows to see the features that connect most totalitarian regimes despite the difference in their ideological programs and which can represent a certain threat even for modern societies, and those points of Russian (Soviet) project of Communist society that allow to differ between Nazi and Communistic types of the Imaginary. At the end of the article, the main types of public heteronomy, characteristic of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, as well as the neoliberal model of consumption society, are also considered. According to Castoriadis, they are contrary to the ideas of social emancipation, replacing it with their principles of (pseudo)rational domination, against which his own project of collective social autonomy stands.",

        "authors": "WEI MENG",
        "created": "2025-05-26",
        "abstract": "This study proposes a set of AI-driven frameworks for conducting visual modeling and probabilistic simulation of strategic pathways in cross-strait unification scenarios focusing on the Taiwan Strait issue. The model incorporates Bayesian networks to capture causal dependencies among key variables such as economic integration, political reconfiguration, military deterrence, and international intervention; employs Markov chains to simulate the evolution of long-term social opinion in Taiwan; and evaluates optimal unification strategies under multiple scenarios via a decision tree algorithm. The framework also introduces system dynamics techniques and advanced visualization tools to enhance the interpretability and decision support functions of the model.The quantitative simulation results show that economic dependence is the core driving force for peaceful unification. When Taiwan's economic dependence on China exceeds 60%, the probability of peaceful unification rises to over 70% within 20 years. Sustained military deterrence significantly reduces the likelihood of direct external intervention, and the probability of successful military unification is significantly higher in a scenario where the U.S. and Japan's military response is limited. The study also finds that a shift in the island's political ecology is crucial: the dominance of pro-continental parties increases the probability of reunification by more than 30%.In terms of short-term unification strategies (within 5 years), simulation results show that the probability of successful unification can be over 85% if high-intensity military pressure, economic blockade and political polarization are adopted, and the U.S. and Japan's military intervention is effectively blocked. However, such strategies come with significant geopolitical risks. To reduce the risk, the model suggests supplementing the tactics with strategic deception, diplomatic mediation, psychological warfare, and precision military operations.This study proposes a transferable modeling approach for simulating complex geopolitical scenarios, combining probabilistic insights with dynamic visualization analysis, to provide scientific support for strategic planning and policymaking.",

        "abstract": "I study the impact of industrial policy on industrial development by considering an important episode during the East Asian miracle: South Korea's heavy and chemical industry (HCI) drive, 1973 - 1979. Based on newly assembled data, I use the introduction and termination of industrial policies to study their impacts during and after the intervention period. (1) I reveal that the heavy-chemical industrial policies promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies through the input-output network, I demonstrate that policy indirectly benefited downstream users of targeted intermediates. (3) The benefits of HCI persisted even after it ended, some of which took time to manifest. These findings suggest that the temporary drive shifted Korean manufacturing into more advanced markets and supported durable change. This study helps clarify the lessons drawn from the East Asian growth miracle.",

        "abstract": "Ten years after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers and the onset of a global financial, economic, and debt crisis, this article reflects on the extent to which the economic crisis has brought about a turning point in societal terms. In light of the state of research on the relationship between financialization, democracy, and social conditions, it appears plausible that the processes of financialization, which contributed to the emergence of a crisis, were influenced by the financial crisis but not completely reversed. The changes in financial market regulation, which were implemented in response to the crisis, did not create pressure for a redesign of the financial system. Therefore, one cannot deduce a significant turning point in financial market regulation from the reform measures taken. However, there are clear indications that the financial crisis has had a lasting impact on the European integration process, trust in democracy, and the political culture. Accordingly, the financial crisis can be seen as a turning point in history, primarily due to its effects on social areas beyond the financial system.",

        "created": "2025-05-27",
        "abstract": "Despite being widely regarded as effective labor market policies, the impact of job search services on employment remains contested. Recent research challenges the assumption that the intensity of such programs is directly related with its effectiveness. We evaluate the effects of two treatments of an Italian active labour market program called Assegno per il Lavoro. Each intervention is made up of a voucher to fund job search assistance and a performance-based payment related to job search intermediation. Participants are assigned to a certain group with a certain treatment endowment that is increasing as a function of a scoring variable. Leveraging this design, we applied a regression discontinuity analysis to estimate effects on both employment duration and employment quality. First, being assigned to an intermediate-dose treatment slightly increased the probability of finding an open-ended employment, but this did not generate an increment in the average of days worked. Second, being assigned to a high-dose treatment only augmented the mean and the median of the distribution of days worked during the second semester and it did with a greater prevalence of short temporary contracts. Third, different treatment assignments barely changed the reception of job search assistance, so the impacts stem from job search intermediation. The main policy implication is a shift from a focus on intensity to a focus on other design features.",

        "abstract": "Criminology struggles to achieve progressive problem shifts, or cumulative theoretical development common in fields like physics and biology. This stems from a “precision crisis”: a tendency to accept imprecise descriptions, vague theoretical predictions, and analytical practices that obscure data. Drawing on Meehl’s framework, we argue criminological knowledge risks resembling “Monopoly money in the bank” rather than genuine scientific currency. We propose fundamental shifts: prioritizing precise description of concrete phenomena, subjecting theories to risky tests, critically questioning psychometric assumptions, and generating high-resolution data. While academic incentives are a significant barrier, we also explore arguments that these incentives may reflect deeper disciplinary tendencies that favor broader narratives over precise, falsifiable knowledge. The path toward cumulative criminology involves developing approaches that precisely capture complexity while yielding falsifiable knowledge, rather than lowering standards.",

Victim-abusers dyads were successfully randomised at court in 85% of cases and the deterrence message was delivered to the intervention group in 83% of cases, half of which were in court and half of which were via telephone or post. All eligible victims were offered the alarm by a police domestic abuse liaison officer, but fewer than 10% accepted the alarm. No statistically significant difference was observed in rates of order breach or domestic abuse crimes across conditions. Randomisation and delivery of deterrence messaging by police in court combined with the offer of an AREDAA alarm to victims was determined to be feasible, but intervention fidelity was dependent on perpetrator attendance at court and victim support for domestic violence protection orders, both of which were low.",

        "abstract": "Japan has one of the highest suicide mortality rates among the G7 countries, with suicide being the leading cause of death among young people—a serious public health concern. Suicide and related mental health conditions are complex phenomenon that cannot be explained by a single factor; in addition to demographic variables, mental disorders, and socioeconomic status, recent studies suggest the involvement of various environmental and biological factors, such as the gut microbiota, relationships with companion animals, and climate change. These findings highlight the need to move beyond traditional psychiatric and sociological perspectives and to consider a broader One Health approach that includes environmental and life sciences. Our research team has conducted forensic analyses of suicide death cases investigated by medical examiners, focusing on associations between demographic characteristics, psychiatric consultation history, and methods of suicide. We have also examined systemic challenges in Japan’s suicide surveillance framework, including the divergence in populations covered by different data sources and the limited geographic coverage of forensic investigations into suicide deaths. We advocate for the importance of interdisciplinary research aimed at understanding the reality of suicide and implementing effective preventive interventions. Building an integrated registry that incorporates insights from diverse fields and adopting One Health perspective may serve as a foundation for future suicide prevention policy.",

While most research finds negative spill-overs between caregiving and employment, it is crucial to understand the factors under which caregiving has positive spill-over effects. Analyzing Dutch retrospective data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social science (3,543 caregiving situations of 2,042 caregivers), this study examined how factors from the work environment and the caregiving situation are related to two positive spill-overs, namely learned skills from caregiving for paid work and employment being a relief from caregiving. Results from multilevel models show that a working environment with high flexibility compared to no flexibility was related to more skill learning and relief. Further, we found that more understanding of the manager and colleague was related to learning skills, while the manager and colleagues knowing about caregiving was linked to feeling relief. More diverse caregiving tasks were associated with more skills learned for paid work and more relief felt. These findings can guide state or firm-based policies to not only prevent negative but also foster positive spill-overs. Keywords: informal care, employment, work-care",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates climate-induced internal migration in India, focusing on district-level migration patterns and their relationship with climatic stressors using historical census data and statistical modeling. Internal migration, which refers to the domestic movement of people, is often driven by intersecting economic, social, and environmental factors. Climate change is increasing but unevenly playing a role in decisions to migrate. The study emphasizes India’s status as a climate-migration hotspot, characterized by diverse geographic and population heterogeneity, and highlights the limitations of existing migration data, particularly the delayed 2021 Census. To address these gaps, the paper employs a novel statistical approach to estimate district out-migration, district-to-district migration, and district in-migration around 2021 by leveraging data from the 2001 and 2011 censuses alongside temperature and precipitation extremes derived from historical climate records from 1961-2021. The methodology integrates harmonized district boundaries and fixed-effects modeling to account for confounding factors while projecting migration trends under varying climatic conditions. Results reveal significant associations between climatic extremes, both positive and negative and migration flows, underscoring the role of climate stressors in shaping migration decisions. By generating predictive estimates for 2021 migration patterns, the study offers insights into how climate variability potentially influences internal migration dynamics in India. The findings contribute to broader discussions on how to incentivize climate change adaptation given the reality of highly mobile populations in India and provides pointers on reducing vulnerabilities in migrant-sending and migrant-receiving areas.",

Through a mixed-methods approach combining data on 56,680 successful and unsuccessful grant applications submitted to the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and 45 interviews with past members of review committees, we analyse how language intersects with knowledge hierarchies and disciplinary cultures. Our findings show that writing a grant proposal in English rather than in French is associated with slightly higher chances of securing funding, mostly reflecting the greater recognition of applicants who have published in prestigious anglophone journals. However, the worth of this linguistic capital varies significantly across disciplines. These differences stem from how each discipline defines scientific value—whether through a more universal or context-dependent perspective and according to singular or plural hierarchies.",

It builds on a unique set of quantitative and qualitative data to understand why humanities scholars publish. It looks at both basic characteristics such as publication numbers, formats, and perceptions, and differences of national academic settings alongside the influences of the UK’s Research Excellence Framework and the German Exzellenzinitiative. The data involve a survey of more than 1,000 humanities scholars and social scientists in the UK and Germany, allowing for a comprehensive comparative study, and a series of qualitative interviews. The resulting critique provides researchers and policy makers with an accessible and critical work about the particularities of authorship and publishing in the humanities. And it gives an account of the problems and struggles of humanities scholars in their pursuit of contributing to discourse, and to be recognised with their intellectual work.",

        "abstract": "Communal violence remains a pervasive yet understudied form of political violence, often overshadowed by civil wars and electoral conflicts. Although improvements in the quality and accessibility of event data have enabled more systematic and comparative research, significant biases and discrepancies persist. A key obstacle to advancing the field has been the lack of conceptual clarity and standardized coding practices, which hampers comparison of findings. We develop a crisp definition of communal violence and operationalize it with a novel keyword-based coding methodology. Drawing on fieldwork- generated knowledge, we foreground the practices, along with the issues, identities and actors involved. Hence, we focus not only on the ‘who’ but more importantly on the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of communal violence. Applying our method to the case of Nigeria, we generate new insights about the geography and trends of communal violence and their interaction with other forms of armed violence. Our findings underscore that dataset choice and coding rules can lead to rather different conclusions about the scale and impact of ‘local violence’. Our transparent and adaptable coding scheme offers a replicable framework for analyzing communal violence across diverse contexts and datasets.",

Intentionally centering Black perspectives provides an important balance and corrective to mainstream sources. Using two different analytic approaches and a much wider range of original data than any previous study on comparable issues, this paper compares mainstream newswire and Black newspaper coverage of Black protests about policing between 1994 and 2010. Mainstream newswires focused more heavily on protester violence and privileged official and police perspectives, concentrating their attention on fewer episodes in media cascades. In contrast, Black newspapers covered a wider array of episodes and gave more attention to systemic problems, moral critique, and Black community organizing. Overall, these findings show how different portrayals of protests about policing have been constructed in different news sources. These differences matter both for methods and theories of social movements in general and for racialized collective memories in the United States.",

        "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) systems increasingly shape decision-making across crucial societal domains, the discourse around fairness in algorithmic systems (fairML) has intensified. Although fairML research is rapidly expanding, contributions from social science, particularly sociology, remain limited. This chapter aims to address this gap by examining fairness in ML through a sociological lens, focusing on the interplay between algorithmic decision-making and social inequality. We argue that fairML frameworks must explicitly distinguish technical fairness—focused on unbiased predictions—from normative justice, which addresses broader ethical and distributive considerations. We identify and discuss five key challenges confronting fairML today: (1) clearly separating fairness and justice, (2) developing more sophisticated measures of vulnerability and protected attributes, (3) incorporating historical disadvantage and social origin into fairness evaluations, (4) assessing unintended social consequences of algorithmic interventions, and (5) empirically investigating stakeholder preferences toward AI systems. By highlighting these sociologically informed challenges, this chapter advocates for a more holistic, context-sensitive approach to algorithmic fairness. Ultimately, our analysis proposes a sociologically grounded research agenda aimed at critically assessing and enhancing the role of fairML in either perpetuating or alleviating social inequalities.",

We argue that these communities constitute a distinct digital form of political engagement and activism as resistance groups.using the concept of everyday resistance. That means using a set of small-scale, small-impact actions undertaken to contest power relations in a covert and unorganised manner. The data for this study comprises of 84,230 Reddit posts spanning 13 years and was analysed using topic models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The findings demonstrate that discussions in both communities there are strong patterns of a collecitve social identity, despite the anonymous environment. The ways in which resistance is understood differs, with r/antiwork engaging in more radical and explicit discourses, and r/TwoXchromosomes being more focused on traditional activism, legal and political reform. Discussions in both spaces have a high degree of semantic similarity. Based on these results, we argue that social identity salience plays a crucial role in shaping discussions in online resistance communities. This finding is particularly valuable in the field of digital participation, by offering a lens through which online civic and political engagement can be better understood both as a medium of discussing resistance practices, and as a practice of everyday resistance itself.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Post-editing plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of machine-generated translation (MGT) by correcting errors and ensuring cohesion and coherence. With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4o offer promising capabilities for post-editing tasks. This study investigates the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4o as a natural language processing tool in post-editing Arabic translations across various domains, aiming to evaluate its performance in improving productivity, accuracy, consistency, and overall translation quality. Methods: The study involved a comparative analysis of Arabic translations generated by Google Translate. These texts, drawn from multiple domains, were post-edited by two professional human translators and ChatGPT-4o. Subsequently, three additional professional human post-editors evaluated both sets of post-edited outputs. To statistically assess the differences in quality between humans and ChatGPT-4o post-edits, a paired t-test was employed, focusing on metrics such as fluency, accuracy, coherence, and efficiency. Results: The findings indicated that human post-editors outperformed ChatGPT-4o in most quality metrics. However, ChatGPT-4o demonstrated superior efficiency, yielding a positive t-statistic of 8.00 and a p-value of 0.015, indicating a statistically significant difference. Regarding fluency, no significant difference was observed between the two methods (t-statistic = −3.5, p-value = 0.074), suggesting comparable performance in ensuring the natural flow of text. Discussion: ChatGPT-4o showed competitive performance in English-to-Arabic post-editing, particularly in producing fluent, coherent, and stylistically consistent text. Its conversational design enables efficient and consistent editing across various domains. Nonetheless, the model faced challenges in handling grammatical and syntactic nuances, domain-specific idioms, and complex terminology, especially in medical and sports contexts. Overall, the study highlights the potential of ChatGPT-4o as a supportive tool in translation post-editing workflows, complementing human translators by enhancing productivity and maintaining acceptable quality standards.",

The sample size was determined using Yamane's Formula, and stratified random sampling was employed to select the sample. Both primary and secondary data were utilized in this study. Secondary data were collected using a data extraction tool from the annual reports and financial statements of the insurance companies, while structured questionnaires were used to gather primary data. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics with the help of SPSS (version 24). Descriptive statistics included frequency distribution, percentages, mean, and standard deviation, while inferential data analysis was conducted using Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis.

        "abstract": "This paper explores the correlation between financial inclusion and the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects of sustainable development for a big panel of 103 developing nations over 12 years. Financial inclusion as a measure is taken through the Account Age variable capturing adults having access to formal financial institutions as a percentage. The analysis revolves around the three main ESG pillars each through panel data regressions complemented by instrumental variable (IV) approaches in addressing endogeneity concerns. In the Environment (E) dimension, we find conventional agricultural forms (e.g., extensive agricultural land areas and agriculture value added) as having a negative effect on financial inclusion, but the environmental modernization proxies—renewable energy utilization, food production, climate resilience, and areas under protection—exhibit positive and significant correlations. In the Social (S) dimension, development indicator variables like spending on education, internet penetration, life years at birth, sanitation, and gender equity emerge as strong predictors of higher financial inclusion, and labor market participation is found to have a negative effect, possibly due to the dynamics of employment in the informal sector. The Governance (G) analysis shows positive correlation with controlling corruption and innovation production (applications for patents) as arguments for increased financial access improving institutional transparency and economic ingenuity and a negative correlation with regulatory quality as a concern for capacity gaps in rapidly digitizing economies. Through the means of ESG-matched environmental instruments, this paper presents a unique cross-dimensional approach to sustainable finance and shows through counterfactual analysis under both average and counterfactual distributions that policies supporting financial inclusion can be a path to multiple benefits on the environmental sustainability, social equity, and governance effectiveness axes—key requirements for the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Global South.",

(b) Are there variations in total intergenerational social class mobility between countries and regions? We analyzed 50.000 vital registers for 3 countries on total, upward, downward and sectorial mobility. In the country for which we presently arguably have the best data, France, the rate of intergenerational mobility increased, albeit irregularly from the 1720s until 1850 (actually until the end of the twentieth century, as we showed in another stud). For the German and Swedish places, no clear picture can yet be observed: total mobility trajectories vary among places and over time, as do upward and downward mobility. Sweden stands out by a relatively high rate of downward mobility, mostly consisting of farmers’ sons becoming farm laborers. More than expected, however, sons with fathers from outside the farming class succeeded in becoming a farmer. Barriers between the sectors seem to have been weak in Sweden. We can draw two broad conclusions. The first is that pre-modern social class structures were not as stable as either modernization or status maintenance theories claim. The second is that in the case of France, for which we have excellent long-term records, even the major shock of the French Revolution and its aftermath did not cause an observable Sorokin effect for men.",

Drawing on complete records of 792,000 court hearings between 2009 and 2018, we show that immigrant offenders are about ten percentage points less likely to be sentenced under juvenile law compared to natives convicted for the same crime. The immigrant-native gap in rehabilitative justice correlates with anti-immigrant sentiment across space and has spiked in recent years, suggesting a link between the salience of group-based identities and judicial decision-making. Our findings raise concerns about equal legal treatment and highlight that biases in the application of rehabilitative justice may contribute to higher recidivism rates among immigrant offenders.",

Our results show that the privacy labels shown by Visual Privacy significantly impact a website’s perceived risks and benefits, and that they have an indirect effect on privacy protection behavior.

However, interpreting LLM responses to these benchmarks is methodologically challenging, a nuance often overlooked in existing literature. We empirically demonstrate that LLM responses to a standard psychometric benchmark (generalized trust from the World Values Survey) correlate strongly with known survey results across language communities. Critically, we observe LLMs achieve this while explicitly referencing known survey results and the broader literature, even without direct prompting. We further show these correlations can be amplified or effectively eliminated by subtle changes in evaluation task design, revealing that replicating known results does not validate LLMs as naive subjects. Given LLMs' access to relevant literature, their ability to replicate known human behavior constitutes an invalid evaluation for assessing the suitability of large language models as naive subjects. Fascinating though it may be, this ability provides no evidence of generalizability to novel or out-of-sample behaviors. We discuss implications for alignment research and benchmarking practices.",

Grounded in cultural security theory, ideological critique, and materialist dialectics, and drawing analytical inspiration from the systemic and nonlinear thinking of the I Ching, the research critically examines how specific scholarly methodologies and argumentation patterns may undermine cultural sovereignty. Employing conceptual analysis, textual deconstruction, and dialectical reasoning, the study scrutinizes representative cases of influential scholars whose work reflects methodological flaws such as replacing conclusions with assumptions, factual misinterpretation, subjective speculation, and metaphysical presuppositions. These practices, while couched in academic legitimacy, may inadvertently erode the cultural discourse system and weaken institutional safeguards. The findings highlight the necessity for rigorous academic governance and the institutional regulation of cultural research to uphold cultural identity, ideological integrity, and national strategic interests. By unveiling the concealed pathways through which “academic camouflage” interferes with cultural security, this research offers a novel framework for defining academic boundaries and contributes to policy discourse on ideological resilience. Moreover, it aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 16—promoting peaceful, just, and inclusive institutions—underscoring the dual imperative of safeguarding cultural continuity and institutional accountability in an era of complex sociocultural transformation.",

        "abstract": "The smart city strategy drives the creation of innovative solutions to the challenges of urban planning in cities. With its data collection capacity, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a key component of Information and Communication Technologies in smart cities. Likewise, Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a set of vital tools for data analysis and service optimization. This article presents a discussion on the use of IoT in conjunction with Artificial Intelligence to obtain new solutions for planning, management, and services in smart cities. The analysis is based on a literature review that seeks to identify answers to questions involving urban planning in cities, the structuring themes of smart cities, AI techniques, and data collection. The results point to a powerful synergy between IoT and AI, aiming to develop innovative, effective, and integrated services to address the challenges of contemporary urban planning.",

        "abstract": "How do media representations of immigrants affect their access to public services? Though prior research links national news reporting and administrative decisions, little is known about regional variation, an important omission because regional media produces more local news. I argue that street-level bureaucrats are embedded within a regional news environment, where reporting shapes their perception of regional immigration patterns and influences their decisions on public service allocation—a dynamic I term the regional media bias mechanism. To examine this phenomenon, I combine state-level data on benefit reduction rates in Germany’s welfare program Citizen’s Benefit with regional newspaper articles (2010-2020). Leveraging topic modeling and panel data analysis, I show that regional narratives on positive aspects of immigration are associated with more favorable administrative outcomes for immigrants, whereas frames emphasizing financial burdens correspond with stricter treatment. These results highlight the critical role of regional media in shaping policy implementation.",
