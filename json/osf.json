        "created": "2025-08-08",
        "abstract": "This paper offers a critical historical analysis of the intellectual and institutional precursors to the open innovation paradigm. Challenging the perception of open innovation as a radical departure from earlier models, the paper demonstrates that many of its core principles—such as external collaboration, absorptive capacity, and distributed knowledge flows—have deep roots in 20th-century innovation practices and theories. Through an extensive review of foundational literature in innovation studies, strategic management, and organizational learning, this extended paper traces how ideas of inter-firm cooperation, technological brokering, and institutional embeddedness shaped current open innovation frameworks. Emphasis is placed on the path-dependent nature of absorptive capacity, the strategic management of complementary assets, and the evolution of innovation networks. By revisiting contributions from Mowery, Teece, Cohen and Levinthal, March, Hagedoorn, Powell, and others, the study repositions open innovation within a broader intellectual trajectory, offering a more nuanced understanding of its origins and limitations.",

        "abstract": "Alongside the rapid expansion of misinformation research, a line of academic arguments has emerged questioning its relevance and legitimacy. We dissect three key issues shaping the current debate: the prevalence of misinformation, its causal role, and the legitimacy of misinformation research. To bring more clarity to these contentious issues, we introduce three conceptual tools—the (Mis)information Funnel, the (Mis)information System, and the (Mis)information Lens, and use them to demonstrate how to move research on misinformation forward and systematically map future research directions. Our analysis shows that there are fewer genuine disagreements in this field than it seems at first glance, and that those that persist do not invalidate misinformation research. Different positions on each issue imply different directions, both for future misinformation research and policy making. Our analysis is, therefore, relevant not only for misinformation researchers, but also for practitioners and the general public.",

        "abstract": "The geopolitical importance of mountains in Kurdistan has been pivotal in shaping the region's history, culture, and political dynamics. Occupying a vast territory divided among Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria, Kurdistan's unique mountainous geography has historically provided natural protection, fostering resilience among its people. These mountains serve as natural boundaries, strategic strongholds, and cultural bridges, uniting Kurds despite artificial political divisions. This paper explores the multifaceted role of Kurdistan's mountains, emphasizing their influence on autonomy, resistance, and cross-border connectivity. Additionally, the article highlights how these terrains have facilitated guerrilla warfare, preserved Kurdish identity, and served as sanctuaries during political upheavals. By analyzing the historical, cultural, and strategic significance of these mountains, this study underscores their centrality in Kurdish geopolitics.",

        "created": "2025-08-12",
        "abstract": "This paper seeks to take stupidity seriously, focusing on its role in nuclear strategy and AI development. Both of these cases are conceptualized as forms of “brinkmanship” or strategic and technical steps toward increased existential risk in the pursuit of desired ends. This conceptualization brings into relief the complication of means and ends in these technologies and their discourses, and thus also the pertinence of stupidity for their analysis. The resulting main claim is that intellectual capacities are fundamentally entangled with stupidity, and that this entanglement is an underlying driver of nuclear and AI brinkmanship. The analysis finds that concrete effects of the intelligence–stupidity entanglement are indeterminate, but show two counterbalancing directions which can be observed more acutely in the brinkmanship framework, where stupidity is not only a bug but also a feature. The first direction increases risk and uncertainty through systemic self-reinforcement via two paths: by feedback loops joining denser capabilities, expanded confidence, and control loss, and by learning impairment. In the second direction stupidity takes an unexpected leading role in postponing a fatal brink crossing and in extending sympathy and ethical concern even beyond human circles.",

        "abstract": "Over the previous two decades, campaign contributions from small donors to congressional elections have surged, and new technologies have transformed the process of political fundraising. How does money from small donors change how legislators take positions and behave in Congress? ActBlue is a digital platform that has lowered the non-monetary costs of individual contributions and has processed billions of dollars in donations for Democratic candidates and causes. Using a difference-in-differences design based on staggered ActBlue adoption by House candidates, I find that when candidates join ActBlue, they raise more money from individual donors. This is predominantly driven by growth in small-donor contributions.",

        "abstract": "Background: A nationally representative longitudinal survey in the USA found a decrease in population-level support for political violence from 2022 to 2023. This individual-level analysis of those data examines associations between the occurrence of 18 specified life events and subsequent change in views on political violence. Methods: Participants in the Life in America Survey were members of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel. Wave 2 of the survey was fielded online May 18-June 8, 2023; all respondents to 2022’s Wave 1 who remained in KnowledgePanel were invited to participate. We calculated individual scores for 2022 and 2023 on 35 political violence measures from the first component of an ordinal principal components analysis and computed the difference in scores for individual respondents from 2022 to 2023 to represent a 1-year change in these measures. Our principal outcomes are adjusted mean differences in change scores from 2022 to 2023 between individuals experiencing and not experiencing the 18 life events. Results: The completion rate was 84.2%; there were 9385 respondents. Support for political violence decreased for 19.9% of respondents, increased for 14.2%, and remained unchanged for 65.9%. When events were considered individually in a model that adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and other life events, only “things improved for me financially” was associated with decreased support for political violence among respondents as a whole; “I gave up on politics” was associated with an increase. No event was associated with change among both men and women when they were analyzed separately. Among respondents who reported in 2022 that violence was usually or always justified for at least 1 political objective, no events were associated with change in support for political violence. Among those who strongly approved in 2022 of violent extremist organizations or movements, “my political beliefs changed a lot” was associated with a large decrease. Conclusions: In this cohort, few life events were associated with changes in support for political violence across the entire population, but there were important subset findings. The findings support interventions to improve measures of economic well-being across the population and to encourage belief change among extremists as political violence prevention measures.",

        "abstract": "Background: In 2025, during a protracted period of risk for political violence in the United States (US) and with a trend toward authoritarianism evident in the new federal administration, there is an urgent need for information on the public’s support for authoritarianism and government-initiated violence and the public’s willingness to engage in pro- or anti-government violence. Methods: Findings are from Wave 4 of a nationally representative annual longitudinal survey of members of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel. They are expressed as weighted proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with extrapolations to counts for the US adult population. Results: The completion rate was 90.0%; there were 8248 respondents. About one third of respondents agreed at least somewhat that “having a strong leader for America is more important than having a democracy” and that “having political leaders I can trust to look out for my values and interests” was more important than “having election outcomes determined democratically.” About one in four agreed at least somewhat that “we should suspend Congress for a few years so a strong leader can clean up the mess made by politicians in Washington.” A third of respondents agreed at least somewhat that “the [federal] government should use the military to help enforce its policies in the United States.” About 14% of respondents agreed at least somewhat with the use of “private armed militia groups” for that purpose. Between 14% and 20% of respondents agreed at least somewhat that the federal government should arrest ordinary people and reporters or journalists who publicly oppose or criticize “its policies or the President.” About 2% of respondents were very or completely willing to personally “use force or violence” to support or to oppose “the government’s enforcement of its policies” and against individual opponents or supporters of “government policies or the President.” Conclusions: In 2025, substantial minorities of US adults endorse pro-authoritarian views. Smaller minorities endorse and are willing to participate in pro- or anti-government violence. These findings call for sustained, concerted action to preserve democracy in the United States by non-violent means.",

        "created": "2025-08-08",
        "abstract": "This article introduces the Geographical Proximity to Conflict Index (GPCI), a novel approach to quantify a country’s regional conflict exposure. I develop the GPCI drawing on the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) Battle-Related Deaths Dataset v25.1, the Dyadic Dataset v25.1, and CEPII geospatial distance matrices. The GPCI combines three core conflict dimensions – intensity (battle deaths), frequency (conflict dyads), and type (civil vs. international) – with three types of spatial proximity: centroid-to-centroid, capital-to-capital, and population-weighted distances. The GPCI covers 188 UN member states from 1989 to 2024 and offers 18 composite indicators and 18 disaggregated variables that can be used to analyse cross-national and fine-grained conflict dynamics. I apply the GPCI in civil war onset models to demonstrate its empirical utility using the UCDP Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD) and the Correlates of War (COW) Civil War Dataset. Results across multiple modelling strategies and measures of proximity and intensity demonstrate that countries with higher regional conflict exposure are significantly more likely to experience civil war onset, even after accounting for economic, demographic, and institutional factors. This study suggests the utility of GPCI in studying civil war onset, duration, diffusion, political instability, terrorism, forced displacement, humanitarian risk, international security, and peacebuilding.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as research tools, but their high resource demands raise significant environmental concerns. While LLMs offer advantages in certain applications, their high energy demands prompt a necessary question for social scientists: Is it worth considering LLMs for every text analysis task? This study systematically evaluates the trade-off between performance and energy usage across computational text analysis methods, including dictionaries, trained classifiers, and open “local” LLMs. Applying sentiment analysis, multi-class classification, and named entity recognition to political documents, we measure energy consumption, CO2 emissions, correlation with human raters, F1-Score and processing time. We find that LLMs perform well on sentiment analysis, closely matching human judgment, but at relatively high environmental costs. For classification and named entity recognition, task-specific models achieve superior accuracy and low environmental impact. Contrary to multi-purpose LLM benchmarks, larger parameter counts do not guarantee better performance on text classification tasks. Introducing a CO2 Adjusted F1-Score, we observe that smaller and more efficient models, such as Mistral-Nemo (12B), outperform larger quantized models like Deepseek-R1 (32B). Our findings highlight the necessity for thoughtful model selection, rather than defaulting to LLMs. A \"right-fit\" approach, employing task-specific, lighter methods offers performance and sustainability benefits.",

        "abstract": "This research proposes integrating real-world assets (RWAs) into a blockchain-based supply chain to address traditional challenges of transparency, inefficiency, and security. The framework supports both centralized and decentralized operations within a consortium, ensuring flexibility for diverse organizational needs. Security features include private transactions via Quorum and Hyperledger Besu clients, asymmetric encryption for app-to-app messaging, and confined nodes/services to specific environments. Scalability is achieved through multiple blockchain networks with firewall isolation, while optional cloud integrations enhance efficiency. Organizational identities are managed securely using digital certificates, and a granular block explorer ensures transparency and accountability. This integration improves efficiency, transparency, and trust in food supply chains, benefiting all stakeholders. The proposed RWAs system in the case study is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for both centralized and decentralized consortium operations. This dual capability ensures that organizations can choose the operational structure that best suits their needs, whether controlled by a single entity or shared across multiple participants. Additionally, the system supports tiered subscriptions within a consortium, enabling diverse organizations with varying requirements to coexist harmoniously. In conclusion, this research demonstrates how integrating real-world assets into a blockchain-based food supply chain can significantly improve efficiency, transparency, and trust. By addressing critical challenges through innovative use of technology, the proposed system offers a robust framework for modernizing food supply chains, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders from producers to consumers.",

        "authors": "Thomas Lyttelton, Dylan Nelson, Nathan Wilmers",
        "created": "2025-08-12",
        "abstract": "Prominent employers, from Microsoft to the State of Maryland, are increasingly dropping college degree requirements when hiring. Does this provide upward mobility for workers without a college degree? Matching job postings to hires in US administrative data, we show that employers have reduced the share of posts requiring a college degree by more than 10% since 2011. Non-college workers who move to jobs that have dropped degree requirements see substantial and enduring upward mobility. Compared to similar workers on similar pre-hire earnings trajectories, they earn a $6000 per year premium that endures for at least five years after the job move and across subsequent transitions. These hires are more likely to be Black, Hispanic, and female than incumbent workers. Employers also see benefits, as removing degree requirements reduces labor costs: although non-college workers hired into decredentialed jobs earn more than similar non-college workers, they make less than college graduates hired in the same job. Despite these benefits, most employers that drop explicit college requirements continue to hire college graduate applicants into those positions. We find suggestive evidence that employers struggle to integrate new non-college hires and that they face backlash from existing employees. Overall, decredentialed jobs are a promising route to upward mobility for disadvantaged workers, but only when employers follow through beyond job posting language.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in enhancing nutritious food affordability and promoting healthy eating among low-income households in the United States. By analyzing recent data on SNAP participation trends, economic impacts, and barriers to healthy eating, we demonstrate the program's significant contribution to food security and its responsiveness to economic conditions. The research highlights SNAP's multiplier effect on the economy and its success in reducing food insecurity rates. It also identifies persistent challenges, such as the high cost of nutritious foods and other barriers that SNAP participants face in maintaining a healthy diet. It incorporates insights from the FY 2025 SNAP-Ed Plan Guidance, emphasizing the program's commitment to evidence-based, comprehensive approaches to nutrition education and obesity prevention. The analysis highlights the critical role of coordination and collaboration with other nutrition assistance programs and stakeholders in enhancing SNAP’s effectiveness. This paper offers a nuanced understanding of the SNAP programs' successes and challenges, informing potential improvements to further enhance food security, nutrition, and overall well-being among vulnerable populations in the United States.",

We build a conceptual model of the trait value chain—from IP origination through multigenerational licensing and secondary finance—and analyze distributional and ethical consequences under competing regulatory regimes (patent exclusivity, FRAND-style licensing, royalty caps, and trait commons). The contribution is a political–economy account that connects molecular IP to household welfare and macro–finance, while offering policy tests that distinguish emancipatory from extractive designs.",

        "abstract": "In response to increasing difficulties faced by firms in filling training positions, Germany intro-duced a minimum apprenticeship wage (MAW) of 515€ in 2020. Theoretically, the MAW’s effect is ambiguous: higher costs may reduce firms’ incentives to offer training positions, while increased wages could make apprenticeships more attractive, potentially increasing applicant numbers. It remains unclear which effect predominates in terms of actual take-ups. This paper provides first empirical analyses of the MAW’s impact on offered apprenticeship positions and actual take-ups. Using a difference-in-differences design with firm-level panel data, we find negative effects on both offered and filled trainings. This finding is robust to sensitivity analyses, including placebo tests for diverging trends before treatment, effects on other employee groups, inclusion of controls covering COVID-19 affectedness, post-treatment selection and attrition. The results suggest that the negative impact on offers dominated possible gains and did not lead to more entrants into the training system.",

        "abstract": "While natural resource wealth should, in theory, fuel development, many extractive economies remain structurally excluded from financial services. This paper investigates the hypothesis of a « financial exclusion curse » in resource-rich African countries, by empirically comparing them to resource-poor but financially inclusive peers. Using Propensity Score Matching, the Synthetic Control Method, and dynamic panel GMM models, we demonstrate a robust negative relationship between resource dependency and financial inclusion. Yet, comparative insights from Southeast Asia and Latin America reveal that inclusive financial ecosystems can flourish—even in rent-driven contexts—when institutional quality, digital innovation, and proactive policy align. Our findings call for a paradigm shift: beyond banking access, states must reshape financial infrastructures to democratize opportunity in resource economies.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel measure of corporate hierarchies for over 2,500 U.S. public firms. This measure is obtained from online resumes of 16 million employees and a network estimation technique that allows us to identify hierarchical layers. Equipped with this measure, we document several facts about corporate hierarchies. Firms have on average ten hierarchical layers and a pyramidal organizational structure. More hierarchical firms have a more educated workforce, higher internal promotion rates, and longer employee tenure. Their operating performance is higher, but they face higher administrative costs. They are more active acquirers and produce more patents, but not higher-quality patents. They exhibit lower stock return volatility and more stable cash flows. We also examine how companies adjust their hierarchies in response to demand and knowledge shocks. We find that biotech companies increased their number of layers following the Covid-19 pandemic, while companies flattened their hierarchies following the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. These findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions of existing models of corporate hierarchies.",

        "abstract": "Using both census and survey data, this study analyzes educational assortative mating trends over half a century in Brazil. Odds of both overall and group-specific homogamy, as well as odds of crossing educational barriers, are estimated. Results suggest that, after four decades of continuous decline, overall homogamy increased in the first decade of this century. This rebound stems from a shift in the balance between long-standing opposite trends: increasing odds of intermarriage among lower educational levels and more homogamy at the top of the educational distribution. The findings are interpreted in the light of several social, economic and demographic changes that are relevant to union formation. Particularly, starting from a population with very low levels of schooling, educational expansion could initially have only a limited impact on partner markets. The link between schooling and partner choice in Brazil might have strengthened as the expansion reached upper secondary and higher education.",

        "abstract": "The study adapts the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) framework to develop a composite, state-level measure of gender parity for India’s 36 states and union territories. India’s 2025 GGGI score (0.643) and rank (131st) reveal slow progress relative to global peers. The national averages mask wide subnational disparities that impede targeted policymaking. Retaining the GGGI’s four core domains (Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment) the study systematically maps indicators to official, gender-disaggregated datasets, constructing proxies where direct measures are unavailable, and applying statistical imputation for missing values. The resulting state-level index yields a national composite score of 0.780, with near-parity in Education (0.95) and Health (0.96), but persistent gaps in Economic Participation (0.57) and Political Empowerment (0.62). Inter-state variations are substantial: for example, Nagaland (0.77) and Sikkim (0.75) lead in economic parity, while Bihar (0.45) and Assam (0.45) lag; Tripura (0.87) tops political empowerment, whereas Ladakh (0.46) remains the lowest. Findings underscore the methodological and policy value of bridging global indices with granular national datasets, enabling evidence-based, decentralised planning. The paper proposes institutionalising gender-disaggregated data systems as public infrastructure, coordinated by the Ministry of Women and Child Development in partnership with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and state agencies. A public–private partnership model is recommended to finance and maintain such systems, with open-access dashboards to track domain-specific progress. This subnational adaptation not only enhances diagnostic precision but also strengthens the accountability and design of gender-responsive policies within India’s federal framework.

        "created": "2025-08-07",
        "abstract": "The rise of generative artificial intelligence has ushered in a new era where machines produce text with such emotional coherence that they blur the boundary between simulation and sentience. This paper explores the emotional fallacy—a cognitive bias wherein users and even developers anthropomorphize Large Language Models (LLMs), attributing genuine emotions to systems governed solely by statistical inference and pattern recognition. While LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI are engineered to generate emotionally evocative content, their responses are frequently mistaken as indicators of self-awareness, affective reasoning, or internal states. This anthropomorphic illusion carries significant implications for user trust, emotional labour, and the broader ethical landscape of AI deployment. Through a novel empirical study, we evaluate the responses of multiple LLMs to a curated set of emotionally charged and ethically sensitive prompts. The outputs are analyzed qualitatively across three dimensions: linguistic style, affective mimicry, and ethical stance. Our findings reveal a paradox: while LLMs simulate emotion with impressive linguistic precision, they lack any true experiential grounding—underscoring their inherent emotional inauthenticity. To address these concerns, we propose an ethical framework that includes affective transparency, disclosure protocols, and regulation to prevent emotional manipulation in public-facing AI systems. We argue that the unchecked spread of the emotional fallacy may distort public perceptions of AI, affect mental health, and reshape norms surrounding machine consciousness and empathy. By integrating philosophical inquiry, empirical analysis, and ethical design, this paper calls for a paradigm shift—from emotional realism to emotional accountability in the design and deployment of generative AI. Our work offers a cautionary lens and a research frontier in the study of human–AI emotional interaction, particularly as such systems permeate education, healthcare, and psychological support domains.",

We study whether nonresponse can be explained by young people experiencing more life events associated with disengagement from panel surveys. Using data from the Understanding Society panel in the United Kingdom, we employ a discrete-time multinomial logistic hazard model to study nonresponse across panel waves. Consistent with previous research, our analysis identifies lower education, unemployment, immigrant background, and residential circumstances as key predictors of nonresponse. Furthermore, we demonstrate that changes in employment status and (expectations of) residential relocation significantly contribute to predicting attrition among young participants, with age remaining a significant factor. Living with parents also plays an important role, as it is associated with a lower risk of non-contact.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the relationship between censorship policies, public emotional responses, and resistance in the specific context of information censorship in China. We employ an agent-based model to monitor resistance within the context of the Chinese censorship apparatus. In doing so, this study investigates the impact of sympathy on resistance and examines the divisions within the public by creating two groups: \"little pink\" representing pro-government forces and \"normal citizens\" representing apolitical forces. Our findings reveal that when apolitical citizens exhibit sympathy towards each other, a significant portion of the population is likely to engage in resistance. Sympathy towards individuals facing state coercion undermines the efficacy of censorship’s mitigating effects, thereby facilitating resistance. Furthermore, public divisions have a positive influence on the proliferation of resistance groups, contributing to their radicalization and subsequently delegitimizing the government.",

        "abstract": "While the causes of the international youth crime decline have been disputed, it has been proposed that changing policing responses may have contributed. This study examines whether increased rates of police-led diversion have contributed to the youth crime decline in Australia. Fixed effects panel regressions were undertaken to examine the association between police diversion rates and youth offending prevalence and reoffending across regions in New South Wales and Victoria from 2005 to 2019. A significant decline in youth offending prevalence in this period was found but also a decline in police diversion rates for young people, and there was a lack of association between diversion rates and youth offending prevalence. In contrast, youth reoffending increased during this period. Notably, regions with higher diversion rates had significantly lower levels of youth reoffending. Findings suggest that police-led diversion is unlikely to have played a primary role in the Australian youth crime decline but may have reduced growth in reoffending in regions where it was used more frequently. Findings also indicate that youth offending declines have been socioeconomically conditioned. Implications for the causes of the youth crime decline and policing responses to young people are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Digital commerce thrives on advertising, with many of the largest technology companies relying on it as a significant source of revenue. However, in the context of information-seeking behavior, such as search, advertising may degrade the user experience by lowering search quality, misusing user data for inappropriate personalization, potentially misleading individuals, or even leading them toward harm. These challenges remain significant as conversational search technologies, such as ChatGPT, become widespread. This paper critically examines the future of advertising in conversational search, utilizing several speculative examples to illustrate the potential risks posed to users who seek guidance on sensitive topics. Additionally, it provides an overview of the forms that advertising might take in this space and introduces the “fake friend dilemma,” the idea that a conversational agent may exploit unaligned user trust to achieve other objectives. This study presents a provocative discussion on the future of online advertising in the space of conversational search and ends with a call to action.",

Four key areas of contention are identified: the definition and conceptualization of obesity; the methods used to measure it; the approaches deemed most effective for treatment; and the question of responsibility. These debates reflect fundamentally divergent perspectives that cannot be fully reconciled— and arguably should not be. Each viewpoint contributes valuable insights into how obesity is understood and addressed in contemporary society.

The markings differed between the two schools and they were categorized into names, quotes, symbols, and drawings, revealing recurring emotional, social, and cultural themes. Drawing on the theories of Michel de Certeau, James C. Scott, Norman Fairclough, and Pierre Bourdieu, the paper discusses that desk graffiti might be seen as a sort of everyday communication shaped by habitus, power structures, and the desire for agency. The study also touches on Marx’s distinction between 'class in itself' and 'class for itself,' hypothesizing that desk drawings may reflect deeper class-based inequalities in self-expression and social awareness. It further links these expressions to insights in customers behavior, where personal marks, like doodles or brands, serve as identity tools. These findings suggest that even in structured environments like classrooms, individuals find creative ways to retrieve space and voice.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, HR Analytics has evolved from descriptive dashboards to advanced algorithmic decision-systems that now influence hiring, shift allocation, performance evaluation, and even dismissal—often with diminished human agency. This paper critically investigates how such algorithmic management in HRM—the integration of AI-driven tools into core HR functions—is reshaping worker autonomy, managerial legitimacy, and the identity of the HR profession itself. Based on a hermeneutic review of 48 peer-reviewed studies (2019–2025) and 7 recent policy reports, we trace the evolution from data-driven insight to data-driven control. While algorithmic systems offer efficiency and scalability, they also introduce opacity, lack of transparency, and psychological strain—particularly when decision-making is fully delegated to machines. Anchored in Self-Determination Theory and Labour Process Theory, we propose a novel three-stage DDD framework—Datafication (expansion of data capture), Delegation (increased algorithmic authority), and Displacement (removing human intervention)—to assess the intensity of algorithmic control in organisational settings. We offer a conceptual model to help HR scholars and practitioners diagnose risks of algorithmic governance and develop ethical countermeasures. We conclude with an agenda for Responsible Algorithmic HRM and outline actionable research pathways—including design-based, comparative, and qualitative studies—for future PhD-level work on people analytics, worker well-being, and digital governance.",

        "abstract": "In today’s attention economy, the first three seconds of a video can determine whether a viewer stays on and watches it or scrolls away. This study analyzes 46,605 TikTok “hooks\", the opening line of text or speech in a post, drawn from more than 20 content categories. Using emotion‐richness scoring, rhetorical device flagging, and mixed statistical‐machine-learning models, the analysis compares emotional versus informational hooks and evaluates five persuasion devices (questions, “how to” framing, second-person address, negation, and urgency cues). Emotional hooks are scarce (≈ 3.2 % of posts) yet drive proportionally higher comments and shares, suggesting deeper audience resonance, while any advantage to likes is modest. Curiosity gaps and urgency statements outperform direct address or instructional phrasing across most categories, while optimal hook length shifts dramatically based on the niche, ranging from ≈ 9 words in news to ≈ 90 in entertainment. Unsupervised clustering uncovers five stable hook archetypes, with Meta/Community Humor and Fast &amp; CTA-Heavy styles leading the chart as the strongest predictors of engagement. Regression-tree, random-forest, and SHAP analyses connect on content category, hook length, urgency cues, and emotional richness as the most reliable predictors of performance. Collectively, the findings highlight that viral success on short-form video rests on an interplay of tone, rhetorical craft, and category norms rather than any single “magic phrase.” Practical guidelines are offered for creators and marketers aiming to design hooks that capture attention in the critical first few seconds.",

In this digital ethnography of four Finnish alternative health influencers, we examine how influencers contributed to politicisation and polarisation of health attitudes and pandemic governance, and how these dynamics evolved from the early to later stages of the pandemic. Drawing on social media content from three key periods - early pandemic (Jan–Jun 2020), late pandemic (Oct-Dec 2021), and post-pandemic (May-Apr 2025) – the study reveals that influencers fostered politicisation and polarisation of health as well as distrust in authorities. They did so by leveraging: 1) lay expertise grounded in personal (pre-pandemic) healing narratives, 2) alternative immunological framings, 3) overt political opposition to public health measures, and 4) engagement with conspiracy narratives. The influencers’ communication was marked by opportunism, blending political activism, commercial interests, and personal wellness branding. By aligning with values of authenticity and trust, they cultivated belonging within alternative or conspiritual health communities. However, the influencers followed diverse trajectories in terms of politicisation and conspirituality, demonstrating the pandemic polarisation of health attitudes even within the alternative health scene. This study offers critical insights into the evolving dynamics of health politicisation and the role of social media in shaping public trust in medical expertise.",

        "abstract": "This study reinterprets the phrase \"jí yú qiū yì\" (急於丘役) from Sun Tzu’s Art of War (\"The Use of Troops\" chapter), arguing that it does not refer to institutional conscription by rulers but rather signifies the desperate flight of civilians into mountainous wilderness to engage in \"survival labor\" (private/subsistence corvée) due to wartime economic collapse. The research employs three methodological approaches: Linguistic archaeology—deconstructing the semantic evolution of \"jí yú\" (volitional urgency), \"qiū\" (marginal spaces), and \"yì\" (gray/illicit labor). Historical pathology—analyzing Warring States-era refugee phenomena and household registry collapse using excavated texts (e.g., Liye Qin slips). Theoretical synthesis—constructing a \"political economy of exodus\" framework to dialogue with Western theories (Hobbes’ social contract, Scott’s Zomia, Tilly’s state formation). The findings offer historical insights for contemporary refugee governance, demonstrating how premodern China’s collapse dynamics anticipate modern state fragility patterns.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses the heightened fear of crime experienced by women, which often leads to the adoption of self-protective behaviors that can negatively impact their quality of life. Focusing on a hot-spot in the city of Donostia-San Sebastián undergoing redesign, the research is conducted in two phases: pre-intervention and post-intervention. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the study employs systematic observation using the SUE tool, surveys, and Safety Walks to gather data. Findings indicate a high prevalence and frequency of fear of crime among female participants, with a significant reduction in fear observed post-intervention. Consistent with the Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) framework, factors such as physical design, area activity, and user profiles are identified as key determinants of women's insecurity. Notable improvements in both the physical and social characteristics of the urban environment are evident between the two phases. The consistency of results across the three methodological tools reinforces the validity and reliability of the findings, highlighting the potential of mixed methodologies. Overall, the study suggests that urban redesign effectively reduces fear of crime among women, offering insights for urban planning and policy-making to create safer, more inclusive public spaces.",

Taylor (1856-1915) and his book The Principles of Scientific Management (1911) have received enormous attention from management scholars, historians, journalists and activists over the past century and more. By comparison, the directly related, and much-cited, concept of ‘Taylorism’ has received minimal scholarly scrutiny. Drawing on historical archives, scholarly articles and books, government reports, newspapers, oral history interviews, and documentaries, this study examines the use of Taylorism from late in Taylor’s life to date. In doing so, it reveals seven epistemologically and historically distinct Taylorisms over this substantial period. It chronologically examines the dynamics of how the term has multiplied, grown, and mutated, particularly from the 1960s onwards: for example, through artificially fusing historically disparate terms, particularly Taylorism and ‘scientific management’; in forming a contested site in generational conflict; a growing postwar focus on the development of management as a science; and the role of the U.S. Academy of Management in defining, amplifying and sustaining the importance of Taylor and Taylorism to this day.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the disconnect between inherited Western legal structures and the lived realities of Caribbean youth in the West Indies. Rooted in colonial-era traditions, many justice systems in the region continue to reflect Eurocentric ideals that fail to accommodate the cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic conditions faced by young people. As a result, Caribbean youth often experience unequal treatment within the legal system, leading to disproportionately high rates of incarceration, recidivism, and social exclusion. These legal shortcomings also contribute to broader societal challenges such as gang involvement, exposure to violence, and limited access to quality education and opportunity. Using a post-colonial point of view, this paper critically analyzes the structural failures of Caribbean justice systems inherited from Western colonial rule, and proposes culturally responsive reforms aimed at youth rehabilitation and empowerment.",

        "abstract": "We present the results of a new approach to measuring the occupations of respondents in surveys using Large Language Models (LLMs). Occupation is a notoriously difficult variable to measure accurately due to the very large number of occupations and the technical ways they are described in standard classifications. These features of occupational classification systems mean that the measurement and classification stages are usually not conducted simultaneously, with coding of open responses about job title and tasks implemented in a subsequent stage of 'office coding'. In our new approach, which we call SOCbot, an LLM integrated in the questionnaire scripting software is used to code the job title response to the occupational classification in real-time during the interview. Where the job title does not contain sufficient information to be coded with confidence, the LLM probes for further relevant details on job tasks, industry, qualifications, and so on. SOCbot can also be used in static mode offline on already collected response data. Our results demonstrate that the approach attains rates of coder reliability comparable to trained human coders. We also demonstrate that the approach is feasible in large-scale survey operations and has significant potential to reduce respondent burden, lower costs, and yield more timely and accurate data.",

        "authors": "Mahshid Gorjian",
        "created": "2025-08-13",
        "abstract": "Background The complexity of cities has been increased by urbanization, which has led to systems that are characterized by emergent behaviors, non-linear interactions, and interrelated socio-economic, environmental, and technical frameworks. These processes are frequently disregarded by conventional linear planning models, which restricts their efficacy in addressing sustainability concerns. Complexity Theory offers a conceptual and analytical framework for the understanding and regulation of urban systems as Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs). Methods In accordance with the PRISMA 2020 principles, this systematic literature review evaluated 91 peer-reviewed articles that were published between 1994 and 2024. The review incorporated qualitative narrative integration, theme synthesis, and bibliometric analysis. The data were obtained from Scopus through a comprehensive Boolean search that encompassed topics related to sustainability, urban development, and complexity science. The research was assessed through a multi-phase procedure, with inclusion criteria emphasizing the explicit application of complexity concepts to sustainable urban design. Results Five thematic domains were identified: (1) conceptualizing urban systems as complex adaptive systems, (2) employing computational methodologies such as fractal analysis and agent-based modeling, (3) establishing adaptive governance frameworks, (4) integrating sustainability across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, and (5) leveraging digital transformation within smart city frameworks. There is evidence to suggest that complexity-informed methodologies improve stakeholder engagement, adaptation, and urban resilience. Nevertheless, issues continue to exist, such as poor evaluation of trade-offs among opposing interests, regional research disparities, data limitations, and inadequate policy integration. Conclusions Complexity Theory provides a strong foundation for resilient, integrative, and adaptable urban design. Longitudinal assessment, equity-centered applications, hybrid approaches that integrate conventional and complexity-oriented methodologies, and improved representation of under-researched areas are all necessary for bridging the divide between theory and practice. This paper offers practical suggestions for policymakers, academics, and practitioners to incorporate complexity thinking into urban sustainability efforts.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a national inventory of how Canadian universities engage Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts (SSHA) disciplines in the science-policy interface (SPI). Using a digital humanities methodology, the research team scanned departmental websites at 90 public universities, identifying 4,032 distinct policy-related activities. These were categorized into individual initiatives, punctual activities, and partnership-building efforts. Results show a system heavily weighted toward individual engagement (68%) and short-term activities (21%), with only 12% representing sustained, institutionalized partnerships. The analysis reveals disciplinary concentration in Public Health/Public Policy, Business/Economics, Sociology, Criminology and Law, and Political Science/International Studies, which together account for over two-thirds of all entries. Provincial disparities are significant: British Columbia dominates in total entries, but Québec leads in structured partnerships and government collaborations. Despite widespread SSHA participation across disciplines, partnerships with Indigenous communities, municipal governments, and private actors remain rare. Most partnership-building efforts are aimed at social development and education, with little focus on science policy or reconciliation. The findings expose the limits of a decentralized, individually driven engagement model and highlight the need for institutional infrastructure, funding mechanisms, and evaluative frameworks aligned with collaborative, long-term policy engagement. The study calls for a strategic shift: from rewarding output-based dissemination to enabling embedded, co-productive policy work. Without such realignment, SSHA contributions will remain fragmented, under-leveraged, and structurally peripheral to public decision-making, despite their proven relevance. The inventory provides a baseline for reforming how universities support SSHA engagement at the SPI and for reimagining their role in shaping public policy.",

        "abstract": "Why do some social groups remain cohesive while others fragment into polarized factions? How do individuals resist dominant norms? This paper introduces the concept of social reward economies—structured systems of social feedback that determine which behaviors, beliefs, and schemas are rewarded, tolerated, or punished. We develop a formal procedural framework that models cohesion, polarization, resistance, and manipulation as emergent properties of these dynamic reward economies. We conceptualize cohesion as the alignment of behaviors around a dominant reward economy; polarization as the coexistence of competing reward economies reinforcing divergent beliefs and practices; resistance as the creation of alternative reward economies that valorize dissent; and manipulation as the strategic distortion of reward structures to engineer desired social outcomes. By integrating micro-level feedback processes with macro-level social structures, this framework complements existing theories of norms, power, and resistance through a formal model. It advances sociological understanding by demonstrating how social order, conflict, and change emerge from recursive interactions among reputation-seeking agents operating within and across competing reward economies. This perspective provides new tools for empirical research, formal modeling, and the analysis of cohesion, polarization, and manipulation in contemporary digital and organizational contexts.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a procedural model that formalizes the emergence and stabilization of shared cultural schemas through decentralized social feedback, imitation, and reflexive adaptation. Addressing a core gap in sociological theory, we specify the micro-level mechanisms by which individual cognitive interpretations, guided by recursive social evaluations, converge into collective behavioral patterns and symbolic order. We argue that socially responsive agents, individuals who observe, care about, and adapt to social responses, continuously adjust their interpretive schemas based on the social validation their actions elicit, leading to the selection and reinforcement of intersubjectively resonant meanings. The model demonstrates how decentralized feedback loops generate shared norms and interpretive frameworks, providing a foundation for understanding the bottom-up emergence of social structures. Illustrated through the case of the neurodiversity paradigm shift, this framework offers a precise, dynamic account of how schemas and actions co-evolve, highlighting the central role of social rewards in cultural formation. Our contribution advances cumulative theory-building by bridging cognitive sociology with macro-level cultural phenomena, laying groundwork for future research on power dynamics and contested meanings.",

        "abstract": "Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) is essential for the sustainable expansion of urban areas due to its ecological, social, and economic advantages. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) enable comprehensive, multi-scale spatial evaluations of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI); however, current research is fragmented, exhibiting voids in scope, methodological integration, and cross-disciplinary coverage of benefits. This systematic review was designed to (a) identify the components of UGI that were evaluated using GIS from 2020 to mid-2024, (b) evaluate the data sources, models, and analytical techniques used, and (c) assess methodological advancements, such as the integration of interdisciplinary strategies and artificial intelligence (AI). Scopus and the Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index) were searched for peer-reviewed English publications published between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2024, in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 standards. Empirical GIS- based studies of urban green infrastructure were identified by the inclusion criteria. Titles, abstracts, and complete texts were independently reviewed by a reviewer, who resolved any discrepancies through consensus. The quality was evaluated based on four criteria: the provision of optimization plans, methodological transparency, GIS detail, and clarity of objectives. Out of 1,592 records that were identified, 20 studies satisfied all the inclusion criteria. The most significantly represented countries were China, Saudi Arabia, and Spain, with research conducted in 13 countries. GIS applications encompassed ecological benefits (such as carbon sequestration), resilience, environmental equity, social benefits, and aesthetic evaluation. The analytical methods employed in this study included multi-criteria decision analysis (e.g., AHP, OWA, CoCoSo), spatial statistics, network analysis, and model integration (e.g., InVEST), with data sources included governmental, commercial, academic, and open platforms. AI- assisted data processing, enhanced weighting systems, improved visualization, and expanded interdisciplinarity were among the methodological advancements. GIS-based UGI assessments have developed into multidimensional, integrated research; however, there are still deficiencies in the evaluation of social benefits, the incorporation of 2 resident perspectives, and the establishment of clear definitions. The precision, inclusivity, and policy significance of future UGI planning can be enhanced by implementing participatory approaches, leveraging AI, and improving transdisciplinary frameworks.",

Socially responsive agents interpret and adapt their behavior based on symbolically mediated feedback, enabling the endogenous emergence of shared norms, cultural schemas, and hierarchical influence structures. By embedding meaning-making and symbolic evaluation into a dynamic feedback loop, the model bridges formal modeling with core insights from cultural and interpretive sociology. It offers a micro-foundational account of social reproduction and transformation that clarifies the procedural “how” underlying the sociological “why.” Crucially, the framework is designed to support cumulative theory building. Companion papers systematically extend the model to account for increasingly complex social phenomena—progressing from behavioral norm emergence to schema convergence and power asymmetries—demonstrating how formal models can incrementally incorporate interpretive, structural, and symbolic dimensions of social life.",

        "abstract": "This scoping review examines the contributions of Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts (SSHA) disciplines at the science-policy interface (SPI), synthesizing findings from 71 peer-reviewed articles published between 2008 and 2022. The SPI refers to the zone of interaction between academic research and public decision-making, where knowledge is mobilized to inform policy. While traditionally dominated by STEM fields, the SPI increasingly relies on SSHA expertise to address societal challenges characterized by complexity, uncertainty, and value conflict. SSHA fields contribute uniquely through contextual research, deliberative facilitation, and evidence dissemination; activities essential for policy processes that involve human behavior, ethics, governance, and culture. Despite their relevance, SSHA engagement at the SPI is constrained by two persistent barriers: low connectivity (across disciplines and sectors) and low institutional capacity (within both academia and policy systems). Structural misalignments, disciplinary silos, and underdeveloped collaborative infrastructures limit SSHA influence. However, where SSHA integration succeeds, it is driven by trusted relationships, reflexive institutional cultures, boundary-spanning actors, and co-designed partnerships. Disciplines with applied orientations (e.g., economics, bioethics) tend to integrate more readily, though often by conforming to dominant evidence standards rather than shifting them. To realize SSHA’s full potential, the SPI must evolve beyond STEM-centric paradigms. Institutional redesign is required to embed epistemic diversity, participatory infrastructures, and policy-facing mechanisms that support SSHA leadership. The review identifies the need for alternative impact frameworks and expanded empirical research across underrepresented disciplines and regions. SSHA are not auxiliary to science-policy work; they are integral to its legitimacy, accountability, and effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "This study explored the cultural perceptions of ADHD in individualist (Ireland) and collectivist (Turkey) societies, examining how these perceptions influence experiences, treatment-seeking behaviors, and support systems. The research aimed to understand how cultural narratives shape ADHD stigma, diagnosis, and perception in both contexts. Using qualitative semi-structured online interviews, data was collected from Turkish and Irish participants. The study focused on three key areas: stigma, treatment-seeking behavior, and lived experiences of individuals affected by ADHD. Interviews were conducted in English, and thematic analysis was used to identify cross-cultural patterns in ADHD perceptions. Findings indicated that in Turkey, ADHD is often framed as a behavioral or moral issue, contributing to stigma and reluctance to seek diagnosis or treatment. In contrast, ADHD in Ireland is increasingly normalised through social discourse, leading to both greater acceptance and concerns around legitimacy and self-diagnosis. Social constructionist perspectives suggest that ADHD is not solely a biological disorder, but influenced by cultural narratives that significantly impact perceptions. In this context, Turkish discourse seems to reinforce traditional stereotypes while Irish discourse appears to promote normalisation, seemingly at the expense of diagnostic validity. These findings highlighted how stigma manifests cross-culturally in different forms, the financial and systemic barriers to support in both cultures, and the need for culturally sensitive interventions and diagnostic frameworks. This research contributes to growing literature on mental health stigma within cross-cultural psychology. Limitations include potential language barriers, sample size constraints, and the researcher’s positionality. Future research should explore intersectional factors such as gender and socioeconomic status to develop a more nuanced understanding of ADHD across diverse cultural settings.

        "abstract": "This paper develops a procedural model to formalize the emergence of power as an emergent property of decentralized social feedback, imitation, and influence dynamics. Building on prior models of norm emergence, we extend the framework to incorporate heterogeneous influence weights reflecting agents' symbolic standing and material resources. In doing so, we bridge classical sociological theories of power—including Weberian authority, Bourdieuian capital, and Emersonian dependence—with a tractable microfoundational mechanism grounded in reward-sensitive behavior and reputational dynamics. We demonstrate how differential weighting of social feedback leads to the stabilization of power hierarchies and centralized influence within groups. The model formalizes power as a process rather than a static attribute, providing a unified account of how influence asymmetries emerge, persist, and shape collective action. We illustrate these dynamics with the case of Harriet Tubman's leadership in the Underground Railroad, showing how symbolic legitimacy and strategic resource use combined to produce charismatic authority. By clarifying the procedural underpinnings of power emergence, our contribution advances the understanding of influence, authority, and social structure, laying groundwork for cumulative theory-building.",

        "abstract": "The climate crisis represents an unprecedented challenge for societal risk management, and the home insurance market has come under intense scrutiny as the consequences of climate change have worsened. Insurers argue that pricing according to environmental risk can send price signals to consumers: they can reduce these risks by moving or weatherizing their homes to reduce their prices. But insurers also use individual variables (e.g., credit scores) because they may be predictive of losses (e.g., the likelihood of filing a claim), socially salient, and easy to measure. Still, if there is no causal relationship between credit and the underlying risk of insured events (e.g., hurricanes), then there is no price signal: individuals will not lower their risk of hurricane damage by increasing their credit scores. If credit penalties are relatively large, they may also crowd out any disaster price signal. In this study, I use standardized industry data on home insurance quotes from 2021-2024 generated using 157 inputs about prospective buyers, including policy details and home characteristics, where all inputs are held constant except credit score and zip code; these quotes represent marginal predictions from the pricing algorithms of home insurers. Disaster risk measured at the zip code level only accounts for 28% of the variance in marginal premiums; most geographic variation is explained by the state of residence. On average, medium credit homeowners pay $792 (39%) more than high credit homeowners for an identical policy; low credit homeowners pay $1,996 (99%) more. The individual credit penalty is equivalent to a 27-point increase in disaster risk rank. My findings challenge the theory that price signaling in the private home insurance market can effectively mitigate the impacts of climate change.",

        "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly important to predict property prices to mitigate investment risk, establish policies, and preserve market stability. To determine the practical utility and anticipated efficacy of the sophisticated statistical and machine learning models that have emerged, a comparative analysis is required. The purpose of this systematic study is to assess the predictive effectiveness and interpretability of hedonic regression and complex machine learning models in the estimation of housing prices in a wide range of foreign scenarios. In May 2024, a thorough search was conducted in Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The search terms included \"hedonic pricing models,\" \"machine learning,\" and \"housing price prediction,\" in addition to others. The inclusion criteria required the utilization of empirical research published after 2000, a comparison of at least two predictive models, and reliable transaction data. Research that utilized non-empirical methodologies or web-scraped prices was excluded. Twenty-three investigations met the eligibility criteria. The evaluation was conducted in accordance with the reporting criteria of PRISMA 2020. Random Forest was the most frequently employed and consistently high-performing model, being selected in 14 of 23 studies and regarded as exceptional in five. Despite their lack of precision, hedonic regression models provided critical explanatory insights into critical variables, such as proximity to urban centers, property characteristics, and location. The integration of hedonic and machine learning models improved the interpretability and accuracy of the predicted results. Many of the studies included in this review were longitudinal, covered a diverse range of international contexts (specifically, Asia, Europe, America, and Australia), and demonstrated a rise in research output beyond 2020. Even though hedonic models retain a significant amount of explanatory power, the precision of home price predictions is improved by machine learning, particularly Random Forest and neural networks. The optimal results for researchers, real estate professionals, and policymakers who aim to improve market transparency and enlighten effective policy decisions are achieved through the seamless integration of these techniques.",

        "abstract": "Background: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating chronic condition characterised by persistent fatigue and multisystem symptoms, often leading to long-term disability and socioeconomic disadvantage. In Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ)), little is known about the health, labour market, and social service outcomes of people with ME/CFS. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study using the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) to identify working-age individuals (16–64 years) receiving a health or disability-related benefit with a recorded ME/CFS diagnosis. Outcomes were compared to propensity score-matched groups: (1) benefit recipients without ME/CFS, and (2) a general population not receiving any benefit. We examined sociodemographic characteristics, co-occurring conditions, health service utilisation, disability support use, employment and income, and benefit reliance. Results: The cohort included 1,902 individuals with ME/CFS. Compared to the general population, the ME/CFS group had significantly higher rates of emergency department visits (18.8% vs. 12.8%) and pharmaceutical use (32.8% vs. 14.2% for 10+ medications), and lower current employment (18.3% vs. 83.8%). Compared to other benefit recipients, those with ME/CFS had lower hospitalisation (11.2% vs. 20.9%) and disability support service use (1.6% vs. 7.2%), but higher rates of Supported Living Payment (64.7% vs. 49.0%) and long-term benefit receipt. The ME/CFS group was disproportionately female and European, with notable underrepresentation of Māori and other ethnic groups. Conclusions: People with ME/CFS on a benefit in NZ face substantial health burdens, economic vulnerability, and limited access to appropriate supports. The findings highlight systemic policy exclusions that disadvantage individuals with chronic, fluctuating conditions. Improved diagnostic coding, inclusive eligibility criteria, and integrated, person-centred care models are urgently needed to address inequities and support this underserved population.",

        "created": "2025-08-10",
        "abstract": "This article develops a procedural model of behavioral norm emergence and evolution based on the recursive interplay of social action and social feedback. Behavioral norms—shared expectations about appropriate conduct—are foundational to social organization, yet their formation and dynamics remain difficult to model concretely. We address this challenge by introducing \\emph{social rewards}—tangible or symbolic benefits received in response to behavior—as the core mechanism linking individual action to collective patterns. Our model shows how agents monitor and adapt their behavior based on feedback, leading to the stabilization of shared practices, the emergence of reputation hierarchies, and the diffusion of norms through imitation and influence. These dynamics drive the co-evolution of norms and social networks, with reputation connecting individual behavior to broader patterns of coordination and social order. While existing theories often focus on \\emph{why} behavioral norms exist, our model addresses the \\emph{how}. We argue that norms are not merely imposed from above, but co-constructed from below through iterative acts of validation and imitation. The article is part of a trilogy that applies the proposed procedural model to the emergence of behavioral norms, interpretive schemas, and symbolic power structures. Taken together, these papers advance sociological theory by demonstrating how a single procedural mechanism—adaptive reflexivity to socially structured feedback—can generate multiple core features of social organization, bridging micro-level processes with macro-level structures.",

It argues that any narrower perspective is inherently non-systemic, which challenges much of the existing literature on systemic phenomena. By integrating narrative synthesis with this expansive systemic framework, the systems thinking approach reveals how prevailing theories operate within a hidden non-systemic paradigm that distorts the understanding of true systemic realities. A review of diverse inquiries into global economic failures exposes their distorted lenses and a paradox: despite disciplinary and methodology differences, many converge on similar patterns of failure rooted in the non-systemic perspective. While this paper explicitly points to a profound paradigm shift that challenges long-held assumptions, it implicitly paves, if not leads, the way for rethinking the foundational knowledge. In turn, it potentially unlocks solutions to the pressing global social issues challenges.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a critical geoarchaeological reassessment of Gunung Padang, Indonesia’s widely debated megalithic site, through comprehensive stratigraphic analysis, sedimentology, and taphonomic evaluation of depositional layers. Challenging previous interpretations that propose an early Pleistocene-age pyramid (∼20,000 BP), the research employs a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach integrating micromorphology, radiocarbon dating, and geophysical surveys to systematically differentiate natural geological formations from anthropogenic modifications. The results demonstrate that the site’s structural elements, including columnar basalt arrangements previously interpreted as architectural features, are primarily the product of volcanic processes rather than human construction. Stratigraphic and micromorphological analyses reveal localized anthropogenic interventions within a predominantly geogenic context, supporting a multi-phase Holocene occupation (∼5,000–2,500 BP) consistent with regional megalithic traditions. Taphonomic biases in earlier studies are addressed through detailed sedimentological assessment, highlighting the challenges of distinguishing cultural deposits in dynamic volcanic environments. The findings underscore the necessity of rigorous geoarchaeological methodologies when evaluating megalithic sites in geologically complex settings. By reconciling Gunung Padang’s chronology with broader archaeological patterns in Island Southeast Asia, this study refutes claims of an anomalously early human occupation while emphasizing the site’s significance as a later Holocene ceremonial complex. The results urge caution in interpreting megalithic sites without robust stratigraphic and geophysical verification, particularly in regions prone to natural rock formations that may mimic cultural features. This research contributes to ongoing debates on early monumentality and the interplay between geological and anthropogenic processes in shaping archaeological landscapes.",

We find that a) the ocean’s subjective (mean index score = 4.31,) and relational (mean = 4.02) contributions to human wellbeing outweighed material (mean =3.75; +/- 0.001) dimensions; and b) these benefits are constrained for vulnerable communities and underserved demographics due to the existence of personal (e.g., lack of interest or affordability) and knowledge (e.g., where to go and/or how to safely and legally engage) barriers. Our results highlight how structural exclusion from ocean spaces limits wellbeing for marginalized segments of society, a critical feedback loop which may perpetuate inequality and degrade public health.

        "abstract": "The Acheulean technocomplex, characterized by its distinct handaxes and cleavers, represents an integral technological adoption spanning over 1.5 million years across Africa. Its persistence yet variable adoption raises critical questions about the mechanisms of technological transmission and its effect on innovation, cultural practice and hominin behavioral adaptability. A central debate revolves around whether major Acheulean technological shifts resulted from radical diffusion—rapid cultural transmission linked to demic expansions and social learning—or organic innovation—a more gradual, localized process of cumulative technological refinement. Resolving this debate is essential for understanding the levers of Pleistocene hominin cultural evolution and mapping its trajectory more definitively. This paper applies Bayesian phylogenetic methods, a computational framework originally developed in evolutionary biology, to model the branching patterns of Acheulean technological traits across Pleistocene Africa. By treating lithic assemblages as cultural lineages, one can reconstruct ancestral states, estimate rates of change, and test for signatures of punctuated diffusion versus gradual innovation. Our primary objectives are to quantify the phylogenetic signal in Acheulean tool morphology, evaluate whether technological shifts correlate with known hominin dispersals or environmental changes, and assess the relative contributions of demography and social learning to observed patterns. The successful integration of phylogenetic, spatial, and environmental analytical approaches in this study provides a novel, robust framework for interpreting patterns in the Paleolithic record. This methodological synthesis moves beyond traditional typological approaches, offering instead a dynamic, process-oriented understanding of technological change that accounts for both the remarkable stability and sudden transformations characteristic of the Acheulean record.",

        "abstract": "Dairy farming systems, of critical economic and nutritional importance, face mounting climate-related challenges that are expected to intensify without substantial adaptation and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. In response, the U.S. dairy sector has established an ambitious goal of achieving GHG neutrality by 2050, emphasizing climate-smart strategies related to animal, manure, and land management. To track progress toward this goal and highlight pathways forward, we conducted a national-level U.S. survey of climate-smart agricultural among dairy producers, identifying patterns of use, producer perceptions, and typologies of adoption behavior. Our results represent roughly one of every 27 dairy producers in the U.S., making this study one of the most comprehensive national assessments in the dairy sector to date. While prior research has often reduced adoption to a binary outcome, we extend a multidimensional adoption framework to the dairy sector, enabling a more nuanced analysis of producers’ decision-making. Using latent class analysis, we identified five distinct adopter segments: marginal, conventional, confinement, hybrid, and integrative, based on dairy producers’ adoption patterns. Marginal adopters exhibited low engagement and high disadoption rates, while integrative adopters demonstrated the highest adoption breadth and sophistication, combining infrastructure and land-based strategies. Hybrid adopters represented a well-rounded group with the longest practice duration, especially among grazing practices. Confinement and conventional adopters prioritized controlled-environment infrastructure but showed generally little engagement with grazing or costly manure technologies. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that program engagement, perceived practice efficacy, and climate beliefs significantly differentiated adopter segments. Integrative adopters were the only group significantly more likely to attribute climate change to human causes and to engage in organic or conservation programs. Confinement and conventional adopters were more likely to perceive adaptation practices as effective for welfare and profit, while hybrid and integrative adopters viewed grazing strategies as effective across cow welfare, profit and GHG outcomes. Compared to other adopter segments, marginal adopters were more likely to prioritize profit, animal welfare, and future generations, suggesting that values may play a role in adoption differentiation. We also found that perceived adoption barriers did not necessarily limit adoption, as even highly engaged adopters reported greater capacity and informational barriers than marginal adopters. Support services could address these challenges without assuming they are prohibitive to fostering climate-smart agriculture practices. Our work offers practical insights and a more nuanced understanding of dairy producers, reflecting diverse motivations, constraints and structural conditions that shape practice adoption across the dairy sector.",

According to some scholars, our craving for mind-altering drugs is an evolutionary mistake – a hijacking of our reward system. In contrast, the “drunk hypothesis” argues that intoxication has been adaptive and essential for the rise of large-scale societies, because it promotes social bonding, increases cooperation, alleviates stress and enhances human creativity. Here we test this hypothesis using the example of kava, a traditional Pacific beverage with narcotic effects, made from the root of Piper methysticum. Our analysis of 83 Oceanic-speaking societies shows a positive relationship between traditional kava consumption and both political complexity and social stratification. However, the results are not robust to controls for non-independence, especially in the case of political complexity. Moreover, we found no evidence for coevolution between kava drinking and either of the two sociopolitical traits when controlling for spatial non-independence. Despite the cultural significance of kava in many Pacific societies, our results suggest that its consumption was unlikely to have been a major driver of sociopolitical complexity, underscoring the importance of controlling for non-independence in cross-cultural studies.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the intergenerational transmission of Urdu within the Bihari community of Chattogram, Bangladesh, focusing on patterns of language use, fluency, and literacy across three generations. Using stratified random sampling, data were collected from participants representing older, middle, and younger age groups through interviews and observations. The findings reveal a marked decline in Urdu use among younger generations, with Bangla increasingly becoming the dominant language, particularly in education and public domains. While older participants exhibit strong fluency and literacy in Urdu, younger speakers show limited competence, and literacy skills in Urdu are notably rare. The analysis identifies parental language choice, educational medium of instruction, and societal language dominance as key factors influencing this shift. The study emphasize the urgency of community-based initiatives and policy interventions to preserve Urdu as a heritage language, ensuring its continued relevance in the sociolinguistic fabric of the Bihari community.",

        "abstract": "A basic clarification of the concept of stupidity is laid out for a more useful application in subsequent analyses. Stupidity is distinguished from akrasia, error, or other forms of lack or limitation external to reason or thought. Following insights by Robert Musil and Gilles Deleuze, stupidity is clarified as being fundamentally entangled with intellectual capacity. Stupidity does not merely obscure thought, but clarifies it, albeit in complicated ways. Stupidity is not a bug, but a feature, albeit problematic. This conclusion is useful as it can be tested for confirmations, extreme and mixed cases, and exceptions within particular contexts and limits.",

        "abstract": "1. Sumatran elephants (Elephas maximus sumatranus) that are uniquely inhabiting wetlands are species critical for conservation. At the same time, Elephants are also considered problematic in some communities because of their foraging behaviour – attacking farmers’ crops and potentially causing casualties both for humans and elephants. Sumatran communities traditional knowledge holds valuable insights in coexistence with elephants. Identifying the traditional knowledge might help us understand elephant’s ecological role particularly in a tropical wetland ecosystem that remains poorly understood. 2. Using semi-structured interviews, we recorded the traditional knowledge of the Perigi village communities in South Sumatra, Indonesia, a village bordering with elephant’s habitat, based on their recollection of observing and coexisting with elephants, explaining, among others, the lived experience of elephants in relatively undisturbed tropical peat swamps. 3. We find the Perigi community placed the foundation of their coexistence with elephants through elephants’ behaviour of creating lebung (ponds) and wallowing for thermoregulation purposes. The communities recorded a positive relationship between elephants’ wallowing and the enhancement of the fish population, which is attributed to their size and quantity. We deduct this as the result of the trophic cascade from elephant-fish commensalism. Further, our findings revealed the land management practices employed by the community that exchanged between mineral soils and peat swamp as a strategy for living in coexistence with elephants. This coexistence of the local communities with elephants in the peat swamp is a form of co-production on biocultural heritage, and the local communities utilise this relationship for their fisheries activities. 4. The revelation of this mechanism on the positive impact of elephants’ presence on fish and local communities contributes not only to highlighting the importance of traditional ecological knowledge in modern ecological and the elephants-humans reciprocal relationship. We provide empirical evidence that the coexistence of indigenous communities with elephants is built by placing elephants as their own agency of where their lived experience and role in the ecological system as recorded by the communities placed as a foundation for them to design sustainable, resilient coexistence mechanism. 5. The way forward is to follow up on this translation by converting the deduction into evidence-based ecological traits measurement. This approach will unveil the relationship between elephants and fish and uncover other essential factors for the coexistence between elephants and humans.

        "abstract": "With the rise of explosive violence in urban Sweden, gang-related crime has become a dominant theme in Swedish media and political discourse. As individual members of prominent criminal networks gain increasing media attention, the construction of the gang myth—how gangs and their members are represented, circulated, and reimagined—becomes a crucial area of inquiry. This article investigates the ways in which crime content moves through the hybrid news cycle, shaping public perceptions of gangs and their leaders. Using topic modeling of news articles (n=521) and multimodal critical discourse analysis of TikTok posts (n= 73) referencing one of their most well-known gang leader, the Kurdish Fox, we examine how myth-building operates across different media contexts. Our findings reveal a stark contrast in narrative strategies: while news media frame gangs through urgency, fear, and political crisis, TikTok users engage in playful, dissident humor—employing memes, emojis, and remix culture to subvert dominant crime discourses.",

The framework synthesizes insights from social marketing theory, behavioral science, and public health interventions to create an integrated approach for SNAP-Ed implementing agencies. By analyzing existing research on successful social marketing initiatives in public health and nutrition education, this paper presents a structured implementation framework that addresses critical gaps in current practice. The framework's potential application is illustrated through a theoretical examination of how it could guide program development at SNAP-Ed implementing agencies, using Alcorn State University's program planning process as an example. This research contributes to the field by providing a theory informed practical framework that can guide SNAP-Ed agencies in designing and executing effective social marketing interventions.",

Xani though a romantic story, Mam and Zin expresses more than just a love; it reveals the concept of a unity of Kurds. Through his works, Xani worked to strengthen the ideas of Kurdish identity, the necessity of the Kurdish language and independence. It was also for the promotion of Kurdish culture and language that he opted for the use of Kurdish instead of the more predominant Arabic or Persian. This research investigates Xani’s legacy as a writer as well as a voice of nationalism calling for the unification of Kurds. Xani, who is still a prominent figure in the narrative of Kurdish nationalism today, will be examined in this paper through the lens of history, literature, and his insights on the Kurdish leadership.",

This perspective examines the evolving landscape of SEL in Nepal, highlighting progress in policy integration and teacher training while addressing persistent barriers such as limited resources, insufficient educator support, and the need for culturally adapted approaches. Gender disparities further complicate SEL outcomes, with boys often benefiting more than girls. Moving forward, systemic integration, teacher empowerment, localized adaptations, and robust research are essential to ensure SEL’s effectiveness and sustainability. Collaborative efforts among policymakers, educators, and communities can foster resilience and equity, equipping Nepali youth with vital skills for academic and lifelong success. By prioritizing SEL, Nepal can nurture a generation capable of navigating emotional and social challenges in a rapidly changing world.",
