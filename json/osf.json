        "abstract": "Place-based policy in the United States comprises a wide range of government programs that are spread across federal, state, and local agencies and that rely on public, private, and nonprofit organizations for policy design and implementation. We document how loosely connected vertical policy supply chains distribute resources from federal and state governments to recipients at the local level. The apparatus is the product of 150 years of policy innovation, both from the top down, with the federal government periodically launching major initiatives whose place-based impacts tend to be long-lived (even if the specific policies are not), and from the bottom up, with state and local actors engineering their own policy solutions, many of which have endured and now constitute modern policy practice. That practice includes not just tax incentives for business investment, the subject of most economic research on place-based policy, but support for community redevelopment, workforce development, small business promotion, technological innovation, and regional planning and strategy. Intermediary organizations that connect government agencies to local recipients are central to resource delivery. Because they tend to be created, funded, and (or) run by non-state actors, there appears to be wide geographic variation in organizational capacity for place-based policy. Understanding the causes and consequences of that variation is needed for a full accounting of how place-based policy works in the U.S. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

        "abstract": "This report documents our replication of Braley et al.’s (2023) study, which examined whether voters become less willing to subvert democratic norms upon learning that their political opponents are more committed to democracy than previously assumed. The original study found that correcting voters' misperceptions about their opponents' democratic commitments effectively reduced their own willingness to undermine democratic norms. We replicate this finding within the German multiparty context, performing a direct replication with minimal modifications to the original design. Necessary adaptations address the multiparty structure in Germany, where identifying an out-party is less straightforward than in a two-party system. Additionally, we refined some survey items to enhance clarity. Consistent with the original findings, our replication study shows that correcting voters' misperceptions about the democratic commitment of out-partisans reduces their own willingness to subvert democratic norms, from 0.25 in the control group to 0.19 in the treatment group (on a 0-1 scale). In standardized terms, the observed treatment effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.4) closely matches the original effect, exceeding it by 8%.",

        "abstract": "As appropriations earmarks return to Congress, every legislator faces a decision: pursue or refuse congressionally-mandated federal spending projects. This decision is likely influenced by public messaging concerns. We theorize that both credit claiming for federal projects and position-taking against spending projects (“pork busting”) can benefit legislators as they look to improve future electoral returns. We field a nationally-representative survey experiment to estimate the effect of credit claiming and pork busting messages on the perceived effectiveness, fiscal responsibility, and overall approval of an unnamed member of Congress. We find that respondents are likely to penalize the representative’s approval assessment when presented with an outparty message strategy. Conversely, respondents are likely to increase the representative’s personal trait assessments when presented with an inparty message strategy. We expand on these results in an additional analysis and find that these trends persist when controlling for other partisan and demographic factors. We discuss our results in light of traditional expectations, potential mechanisms, and future directions for related research.",

        "abstract": "Members of Congress routinely seek to improve their institutional position to increase their influence over policy outcomes. Prominent among those policy outcomes is the distribution of federal spending projects, where members can simultaneously secure local particularistic spending and its consequential electoral benefits. While institutional position facilitates the receipt of these policy goods, it is less clear whether representatives' position facilitates the receipt of the associated electoral benefits. We test whether a representative's signaling of policy influence through references to committee positioning increases the effectiveness of credit claiming for particularistic spending. Using a survey experiment, we measure how respondents change their approval and effectiveness ratings for a member of Congress when presented with different versions of real-world credit claiming press releases. Overall, we find that signaling influence vis-à-vis committee positioning has an undetectable effect on the effectiveness of credit claiming. This research highlights an important challenge faced by members of Congress in publicizing their roles in favorable policy actions.",

        "abstract": "Political leaders use social media to bypass traditional news gatekeepers and communicate directly with citizens. Visual material is particularly effective for this purpose. However, the images leaders choose should differ by the political context they operate in. Autocratic leaders should focus less on social and inclusive imagery and more on self-presentation compared to their democratic peers. We explore this using a new data collection of more than one million images posted by a global sample of political leaders on social media from 2012 to 2022. Using computer vision techniques, we extract information on the social context of these images, in order to analyze differences between autocracies and democracies. Our results show that democratic leaders present themselves in a more social light than their autocratic peers. There is also important variation within democracies, with more personalist democrats emulating the communication strategy of authoritarian leaders.",

        "abstract": "Presidential endorsements are coveted by Congressional candidates with the hopes of increasing electoral resources and improving electoral outcomes. However, not all presidential endorsements are beneficial to candidates at all times. For example, recent studies have shown that Donald Trump’s endorsements, in particular, had a negative impact on campaign resources during general elections. This research focuses on how presidential endorsements affect voter’s perceptions of and support for Congressional candidates. Using a preregistered survey experiment embedded in the 2022 Cooperative Election Study, we examine how respondents change ideological perceptions and support for a fictional candidate when presented with a presidential endorsement. We find that Trump endorsements carry a negative effect that is mediated by respondents’ ideological perceptions of the candidate. We corroborate these findings with observational analyses among verified voters in the 2022 midterm elections. Altogether, this paper offers a theoretical model that clarifies how this elite behavior impacts electoral decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Wealth plays a crucial role in providing private insurance, investment opportunities, and social status, shaping citizens’ policy preferences. These preferences, in turn, influence government decisions to stabilize financial markets and protect private wealth during economic crises. However, such policies often reinforce wealth inequality, particularly benefiting asset-rich households. Using information treatment and conjoint survey experiments in Australia and the UK in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine how citizens navigate this trade-off. We find that informing respondents about the impact of financial stabilization policies on overall wealth inequality decreases support for such policies, whereas highlighting their effects on even larger wealth disparities between ethnic groups has little effect. Furthermore, respondents are more supportive of targeted policies aimed at reducing general wealth disparities than those targeting ethnic inequality. This distinction in inequality aversion underscores a key political economy challenge in addressing wealth concentration in contemporary multiethnic societies.",

We ask whether citizens’ satisfaction with redistricting in their state is shaped by ends (election results) or by means (type of redistricting process). Leveraging questions on the 2022 Cooperative Election Study (CES), state-level variation in redistricting processes, and 2022 election outcomes, we find that both ends and means shape the public’s satisfaction with redistricting in their state. Among respondents who correctly identified their state's redistricting process for the 2022 midterm elections, those living in a state with a redistricting commission reported greater support for redistricting than those living in a state with legislature-controlled redistricting. We also find that respondents who are represented by a co-partisan in the US House are more supportive of their state’s congressional redistricting process than both respondents who identify as Independent and respondents who are represented by an opposing party legislator. Successful electoral reforms require public buy in, and our results suggest that partisan power considerations and a lack of public knowledge about congressional redistricting present barriers to reforming state-level redistricting processes.",

        "authors": "Sara Aref Zahed",
        "created": "2025-05-08",
        "abstract": "Fairy tales, folklore, and centuries-old fears have long shaped how humans perceive large predators like wolves. In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return of wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has become a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this study examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this style are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a detached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity and urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates an ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and ideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to symbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while selectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male actors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable mothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how ecological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.",

        "abstract": "Quantitative trade models predict that trade elasticities vary with comparative advantages, but empirical evidence remains scarce. We provide causal estimates of this relationship by exploiting a quasi-experimental bilateral trade agreement between Colombia and the United States. Using a local projections difference-in-differences approach, extended with state-dependent local projections to account for heterogeneity arising from comparative advantages, we estimate trade elasticities at different horizons. We find that the average short-run trade elasticity is around 1.5, and converges to approximately 4 after seven years. These elasticities increase with comparative advantages: a move from the 25th to 75th percentile in comparative advantages is associated with a 2-percentage-point increase in the long-run elasticity. To measure comparative advantages, we construct a new Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index -- the system bilateral RCA index -- that exploits trade flows across multiple trade partners while preserving the ability to compare Colombia with a specific trade partner regarding their respective comparative advantages. Our findings suggest that comparative advantage shapes the responsiveness of trade flows to policy changes, which has implications for trade theory and quantitative trade models.",

        "abstract": "This chapter analyzes the distinct adjustment paths of U.S. labor markets (places) and U.S. workers (people) to increased Chinese import competition during the 2000s. Using comprehensive register data for 2000–2019, we document that employment levels more than fully rebound in trade-exposed places after 2010, while employment-to-population ratios remain depressed and manufacturing employment further atrophies. The adjustment of places to trade shocks is generational: affected areas recover primarily by adding workers to non-manufacturing who were below working age when the shock occurred. Entrants are disproportionately native-born Hispanics, foreign-born immigrants, women, and the college-educated, who find employment in relatively low-wage service sectors such as medical services, education, retail, and hospitality. Using the panel structure of the employer-employee data, we decompose changes in the employment composition of places into trade-induced shifts in the gross flows of people across sectors, locations, and non-employment status. Contrary to standard models, trade shocks reduce geographic mobility, with both in- and out-migration remaining depressed through 2019. The employment recovery stems almost entirely from young adults and foreign-born immigrants taking their first U.S. jobs in affected areas, with minimal contributions from cross-sector transitions of former manufacturing workers. Although worker inflows into non-manufacturing more than fully offset manufacturing employment losses in trade-exposed locations after 2010, incumbent workers neither fully recover earnings losses nor predominantly exit the labor market, but rather age in place as communities undergo rapid demographic and industrial transitions.

This paper presents a method to systematically identify Jews by leveraging the distinctiveness of Jewish and Gentile names in Dutch population data. Using two external sources for verification, I evaluate efficiency and accuracy of Jewish samples identified through different combinations of given names and surnames. The results show that incorporating additional family names, such as those of parents, substantially increases sample sizes while simultaneously minimizing errors. Using name distributions by ethno-religious background from mid-nineteenth-century Amsterdam population registers, between 81 and 86 percent of Amsterdam-born grooms and brides are accurately identified as either Jewish or Gentile on Dutch civil certificates between 1811 and 1932. I further demonstrate that the method is effective across time and across the Dutch provinces, producing Jewish samples that closely match their local population shares. Finally, I illustrate the potential of the approach by documenting the socioeconomic ascent of Amsterdam Jews from the second half of the nineteenth century onward, and discuss ways to extend the method through data linking and the incorporation of additional information.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the complex relationship between the performance of logistics and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance drawing upon the multi-methodological framework of combining econometric with state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. Employing IV panel data regressions, viz. 2SLS and G2SLS, with data from a balanced panel of 163 countries covering the period from 2007 to 2023, the research thoroughly investigates how the performance of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is correlated with a variety of ESG indicators. To enrich the analysis, machine learning models—models based upon regression, viz. Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Boosting Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Linear Regressions, and clustering, viz. Density-Based, Neighborhood-Based, and Hierarchical clustering, Fuzzy c-Means, Model Based, and Random Forest—were applied to uncover unknown structures and predict the behaviour of LPI. Empirical evidence suggests that higher improvements in the performance of logistics are systematically correlated with nascent developments in all three dimensions of the environment (E), the social (S), and the governance (G). The evidence from econometrics suggests that higher LPI goes with environmental trade-offs such as higher emissions of greenhouse gases but cleaner air and usage of resources. On the S dimension, better performance in terms of logistics is correlated with better education performance and reducing child labour, but also demonstrates potential problems such as social imbalances. For G, better governance of logistics goes with better governance, voice and public participation, science productivity, and rule of law. Through both regression and cluster methods, each of the respective parts of ESG were analyzed in isolation, allowing to study in-depth how the infrastructure of logistics is interacting with sustainability research goals. Overall, the study emphasizes that while modernization is facilitated by the performance of the infrastructure of logistics, this must go hand in hand with policy intervention to make it socially inclusive, environmentally friendly, and institutionally robust.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates how educational messaging and the timing of attitudinal questions influence stated consumer preferences for sustainable product components. A choice-based conjoint (CBC) survey was deployed to 720 U.S. adults, randomized into four groups with varying exposure to sustainability messaging and priming. Compared to the control group, respondents who were exposed to messaging and priming showed an additional 7–17 percentage point increase in preference share for products with recycled components.

Novel employer-linked household panel data allow us to study how these employer wage-setting decisions affect working poverty. Minimums reduce poverty rates in adopting firms by 30% to 50%, relative to workers in similar jobs, labor markets and competitor employers. Minimums also narrow black/white, college/non-college, regional, and gender wage gaps within firms. Poverty reduction is not explained by shifting worker selection, pre-trends, or offsetting decreases in hours or health insurance.

        "abstract": "Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e., transitivity, clustering), whereby network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to be directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form such ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se or from other processes, such as homophily and more opportunities for exposure. These are difficult to disentangle in many settings, but in social media not only can they be decomposed, but platforms frequently make decisions that depend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we randomize the existing network structure that a user faces when followed by a target account that we control, and we examine whether they reciprocate this tie formation. Being randomly assigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie formation by 35%. Through the use of multiple control conditions in which the relevant tie is absent (never existent or removed), we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that indicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure should be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and we find larger effects when the subject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial role for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what might be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these tendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and information diffusion in online networks.",

We define good jobs as those in industries in which full-time workers attain high wages, accounting for individual and regional characteristics. The share of good jobs in manufacturing has plummeted; for college graduates, good jobs have shifted to (mostly tradable) business, professional, and IT services, while for those without a BA they have shifted to (nontradable) construction. There is strong persistence in where good jobs are located. Over the last four decades, places with larger concentrations of good job industries have tended to hold onto them, consistent with a model of proportional growth. Turning to regional specialization in good job industries, we find evidence of mean reversion. Commuting zones with larger initial concentrations of good jobs have thus seen even faster growth in lower-wage (and mostly nontradable) services. Changing regional employment patterns are most pronounced among racial minorities and the foreign-born, who are relatively concentrated in fast growing cities of the South and West. Therefore, good job regions today look vastly different than in 1980: they are more centered around human-capital-intensive tradable services, are surrounded by larger concentrations of low-wage, non-tradable industries, and are more demographically diverse.

        "abstract": "Recent scholarship suggests that polarization has inflamed political conflict over the boundaries of U.S. national membership. Our study offers an important caveat to this narrative. Using a novel empirical strategy that applies latent class modeling to conjoint data, we find that different segments of the American population use different cultural logics to sketch the contours of nationhood. However, these logics are not systematically patterned by partisanship: most Democrats, Republicans, and Independents articulate a vision of Americanness that fuses ethnocultural criteria with civic-oriented expectations for membership in America’s imagined community. Our findings complement and extend prior research by showing that different modes of measurement can yield credible evidence of both polarization and consensus. Whereas much of the existing literature relies on declarative measures of popular nationalism rooted in self-theorization, our design captures more intuitive judgments about national boundaries that are masked in traditional surveys. Consequently, our approach uncovers greater intraparty heterogeneity and interparty overlap than is often assumed, with two important implications. First, symbolic beliefs related to partisanship may be masking widely held ideas about nationhood embedded in public culture. Second, partisan debates may not only reflect competing nationalist logics, but contestation over who truly represents shared national values.",

Against the expectation that national upgrading trends may mask a diversity of regional upgrading, downgrading and polarisation experiences, EU Labour Force Survey data show clear and unambiguous upgrading. In every region, employment in high quality jobs grew while employment in low quality jobs shrank. These shifts were often large in magnitude: the proportion of employment in high quality jobs increased by more than 10 percentage points in two thirds of the regions studied. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the rate and type of occupational upgrading. Strong upgrading and employment growth in the economic capital regions of Île-de-France (Paris), Lombardy, Madrid and London contrasted with weaker upgrading and sluggish (or even negative) employment growth in regions like Lorraine, Sicily, Extremadura and the West Midlands. That these and many regions have yet to achieve the same proportion of high quality jobs that the economic capitals possessed in 1992 highlights the greater relative difficulty of ascending to the top of the occupational structure in some places than others.",

This drove declines in US labor market inequality for the first time since 1980, as pay increases in low-wage retail, food service and logistics jobs outpaced higher-status occupations. How did these substantial wage increases emerge? Using restricted-use microdata from the Occupational Employment and Wages Statistics and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, we find that rising pay across low-wage occupations, rather than declining inequality within-job or in workplace pay premiums, explains a majority of declining wage inequality since 2015. Contrary to creative destruction predictions, establishment exit contributed little to rising pay at the bottom. Low-paying employers of low-wage occupations contracted, but this accounts for less than a fifth of rising wages at the bottom. The main driver of rising pay was low- and middle-paying employers of low-wage occupations increasing pay. Notwithstanding organizational inertia, major gains for workers' pay can come from changes in existing workplaces.",

Background: Low mental health of single parents is a public health concern. Few studies have examined how patterns develop over the separation process and whether they differ for mothers and fathers. Method: Using data from the German Family Panel (N=1,409 non-separated and 466 separated parents), this paper examines the relationship between separation and parental mental health, spanning the period from three years before to two years after separation. As a method, it combines exact matching and fixed-effects methods. Results: While depression levels of separated parents are higher compared to the control group of parents in partnerships, we do not find any substantial increases in depression across the separation process, spanning from three years prior to two years post-separation. However, we find that patterns strongly differ by pre-partnership quality. Mothers and fathers in low-quality partnerships experience low mental well-being before separation but are likely to see improvement afterward. Conclusion: A longitudinal perspective on mental health trajectories is crucial for understanding the well-being of divorced and separated parents. Often, it is not the separation itself but the pre-existing conflict and stress that lower mental health. In such cases, union dissolution may be a pathway to improved mental well-being.",

How does employer power over wage-setting shape working poverty? High-premium employers may lift workers out of poverty, but they may also exclude low-income applicants. We link household panel income data to employer wage records and find working poverty rates four times higher at low-premium employers, compared to high-premium employers, and poor hires twice as likely to stay in poverty. However, high-premium employers hire poor workers so rarely that they lift workers out of poverty less often than low-premium employers do. Employer pay-setting is a key determinant of working poverty overall: if all employers became high-premium, without changing employment composition, the working poverty rate would decrease by two-fifths. But reshuffling workers across employers would have little impact, as low-premium employers continue to pull workers into poverty. While low-paying employers harbor and produce the working poor, high-paying employers exclude them altogether.",

Increasingly the party of unions and minimum wages is also the party of managers and professionals. In this article, we investigate whether this realignment among the actors setting wages within firms has politicized wage setting. We first show that Democrat managers pay more to hourly workers, even comparing across firms within metro-occupation-industry-year local labor markets. This premium is confined to senior managers and human resources and compensation managers; a placebo test shows that operations managers' political affiliation is uncorrelated with wage levels. We then show, consistent with coalitional behavior, that the Democrat wage premium is larger for Democrat-leaning service jobs than for increasingly Republican blue-collar workers, and larger for women than for men. Democrat managers raise pay more around salient minimum wage increases and become relatively more likely to pay $15 wages specifically. In an experiment in which manager-employee partisan match is randomly assigned, managers are 10 percentage points more likely to assign co-partisans a higher wage. Finally, we show that the Democrat wage premium has grown in recent years, and that this accounts for 12% of extra wage increases for low-wage workers during this period. Taken together, these results suggest a politicization of wage-setting, wherein managers' liberal commitments benefit frontline workers in their political coalition.",

        "abstract": "This chapter examines the enduring relevance of gender as a central organizing principle in society, with a focus on the social psychological mechanisms that reproduce gender inequalities. Building on existing theory and contemporary empirical research, we discuss how gender is conceptualized as a multilevel system of social practices that structures social relations – encompassing individuals’ identities and behaviors at the micro level, social interactions at the meso level, as well as cultural beliefs and social structures and institutions, like organizations, families, and states, at the macro level. We argue that social psychological tools and understandings of how gender operates in social interaction are at the heart of the gender system. These approaches are useful because they specify, for instance, the ways in which cultural beliefs about gender influence a range of important social outcomes, such as a person’s self-concept and their decision-making, divisions of paid and unpaid labor, workplace discrimination, and the structure of organizations. Moreover, they attest to the highly contextual nature of gender interactions, showing how gendered structures are produced, sustained, and transformed overtime. By interrogating the linkages among micro-level identities, meso-level interactions, and macro-level social institutions, we provide a comprehensive overview of current theories and research and make recommendations for future research directions.",

        "abstract": "This paper, based on three research vignettes featuring methodological reflections from visual and multisensory research on international migrations conducted in Norway and Poland, introduces the concept of multisensory positionality. Grounded in the theoretical discussions around positionality developed in migration studies (Anthias 2002, 2008, 2020; Yuval-Davis 2006), and supported by sensuous scholarship (Stoller 2010; Howes 2020), multisensory positionality is a holistic, intersectional approach that recognises the body and senses as crucial aspects of positionality for both the researcher and participants. The paper highlights how these embodied experiences actively shape the negotiation of meaning between people and spaces, both in a research context and as part of the migration experience. As an analytical concept, multisensory positionality addresses the opportunities and limitations arising from the embodied, multisensory experiences of the research participants. It bridges migration and sensory studies by situating the sensory aspects of people’s identities within their broader life-worlds, including the impact of structures and power relations.

While structural factors and third-party influences have been extensively studied, individual partner preferences remain underexplored. This study leverages social identity theory to refine our understanding of partner choice in interethnic marriage. Employing conjoint analysis with data from a 2023 Japanese online survey, I explore how nationality influences partner selection, integrating the concepts of in-group favoritism and out-group derogation into the study of intermarriage. The findings reveal a clear preference for co-national Japanese partners, reflecting pronounced in-group favoritism and weak out-group derogation. I further identify a hierarchy of preference among immigrant candidates, with Western nationalities such as the US and France rated most favorably, while countries like China, Pakistan, and Nigeria are less preferred. This study highlights the necessity of directly measuring partner preferences to uncover the nuances of inter-group bias rather than relying solely on demographic data. By providing a nuanced view of how inter-group bias shapes preference patterns in intermarriage, I contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of partner choice in less heterogeneous societies such as Japan.",

        "abstract": "Understanding who benefits most from schooling is essential both for sociological stratification theories and for informing educational policy debates about the trade-off between equity and efficiency. Using an elaborate differential exposure model, we provide more precise and nuanced insights into this by studying (1) how school exposure affects gains in reading comprehension and mathematics, and (2) whether it adapts inequalities by parental education, migration background, and gender. Leveraging unique administrative data from the Netherlands Cohort Study on Education on ~600k pupils over multiple grades (Grades 1-5), we exploit the quasi-random variation in test dates and calculate the exposure to schooling by the interval length between the mid-term and end-of-term tests. We find that while school exposure substantially boosts achievement by 0.5 S.D. in reading and 1.1 S.D. in mathematics per school year, these gains are not equally distributed. For reading, children with higher-educated parents and those without non-Western migration backgrounds benefit more from schooling, amplifying inequality. For mathematics, we find small compensatory patterns. These findings show that the effects of schooling on inequality are domain-specific, which we explain by the multiplicative nature of skill acquisition in schools and homes – an interaction that particularly boosts reading development in resourceful families.",

        "authors": "Petr Nuska",
        "created": "2025-05-05",
        "abstract": "This article explores the phenomenon of ‘musical blood’ using the case of Slovak Roma to challenge both the specific myth of innate Romani musicality and the broader assumption that musical ability is genetically inheritable within ethnic groups. Rather than debunking racist ideas about primordially assigned ethnic features, the article advocates for a more nuanced and scholarly approach to understanding how musical abilities are constructed, perceived and valued within varying social and cultural environments. The article provides an overview of the literature on the heritability of musicality, focusing on the specifics (and pitfalls) of applying this concept to ethnic groups. Then, it critically examines how societal conceptions of music contribute to the persistence of the musical blood myth, suggesting that these beliefs are rooted in sociocultural narratives and stereotypes. It delves into an analysis of multifaceted sociocultural constructs that sustain the notion of ethnic musical predispositions; different sociocultural contexts shape the perception and valuation of musical enculturation, musical aptitude and music per se. The article then analyses the case of Slovak Roma to illustrate broader theoretical implications, providing a critical lens on the role of systemic biases held by non-Roma (heterostereotypes), Romani self-ascribed identification with the construct (autostereotypes), and mutual interactions thereof. While the article is based on the author’s long-term ethnographic observations in Gemer-Malohont in Slovakia (2013–2023), it pairs material from this context with existing ethnographic scholarship, covering cases of Romani musical blood in different sociocultural contexts. The article reflects on the importance of understanding ‘musical blood’ not just as a stereotype but as a meaningful and impactful sociocultural construct deeply embedded in the lives and identities of Romani musicians and their communities.",

This created a natural experiment where name choices reflected orientation toward the modernizing state. Viewing surnames as signs with ideological and personal significance, I explored how these choices reflected positions on nationalism, identity, and strategies for claiming status and building reputation. I analyzed surname patterns among political elites (4,873 individuals, 1927-1949) and a populace sample using thematic coding and frequency analysis. Elites disproportionately chose surnames featuring newly coined ``Pure Turkish'' words, Old Turkish etymology, and innovative linguistic structures, emphasizing themes of military, heritage, and social status. The general population maintained traditional naming patterns, favoring references to natural elements, physical traits, and occupations. This study reveals how personal choices like surnames can expose alignment with political projects, showing how elites strategically used naming to signal status and ideological commitment.",

I synthesize cultural, interactionist, and psychoanalytic literatures on stigma, boundaries, and gender practice to articulate liminal complicity as both an emotional retreat from stigmatization and a rational means of accruing status and redrawing social boundaries. I conduct a comparative-historical analysis of gendered discourses and practices at different historical junctures to show how analogous processes of (1) normative identification, (2) self- transformation, and (3) distinction from and (4) aggression toward feminized others enable historically subordinated men to elevate themselves without disrupting broader systems of domination.",

Drawing on novel data from more than 200 companies around the globe that participated in four-day, thirty-two-hour weeks with no reduction in pay, we find that 90% of companies continue this schedule. From neoclassical and Marxian theories of the workplace, institutional theories of legitimacy, and gendered and racialized organizational theory, we test three main hypotheses. As expected from labour process theories, we find that some employers revert to a five-day schedule after achieving efficiencies. From theories of legitimacy, we find that organisations that fail to reduce stress are more likely to revert.

To test the hypotheses, I conducted an online survey experiment using a Japanese sample.

        "abstract": "We study the attitudes and behaviors of young people in modern China in their search for love and long-term romantic relationships. Using a sample of 128 Chinese males and females living in China and abroad, survey responses were analyzed to examine their willingness to approach and be approached by the opposite sex, the length of time needed to establish serious relationships, their tolerance toward hookups, as well as their preferences in meeting potential partners and dating activities. Males were more willing to approach females and felt more enjoyment to be approached by females compared to females, with a statistically very significant difference between the two genders (p less than 0.01 in both instances). Females appeared to require a longer time to establish serious relationships than males, with a statistically significant difference between the two (p less than 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the level of tolerance toward hookups between males and females. Categorizing the respondents into several age groups and across four geographical regions did not reveal any statistically significant differences either in terms of their attitudes toward these queries. When it comes to the place to meet partners, schools and colleges are on the top of the list (86%), with eating out as the most preferable activity during dating (95%). Males were expected to pay more during the first date (55%), whereas splitting the bills between the two would be more appropriate as the relationships became more stable (56%). Nearly half of our participants prefer not to have any physical contact before establishing any serious relationships, and three-quarters mentioned that the purpose of dating is to get married. Although it could be a little bit surprising for many people who come from a different background, particularly Western culture, the outcome of this study is nonetheless intriguing. Despite globalization, modernization, rapid economic growth, urbanization, and high level of education, many youths in contemporary China appeared to maintain a high moral standard and traditional value of romantic relationships, while some of them seemed to adopt a more western-style of dating and relationships.",

At the same time, we know little about the extent to which these models actually reflect the demographic attributes and behaviors of certain groups or populations, with conflicting findings in empirical research. To shed light on this debate, we review 211 papers on the demographic representativeness of LLMs. We find that while 29% of the studies report positive conclusions on the representativeness of LLMs, 30% of these do not evaluate LLMs across multiple demographic categories or within demographic subcategories. Another 35% and 47% of the papers concluding positively fail to specify these subcategories altogether for gender and race, respectively. Of the articles that report subcategories, less than half include marginalized groups in their study. Finally, 35% of 211 papers do not define the target population to whom their findings apply; of those that do define it either implicitly or explicitly, a large majority study only the U.S. Taken together, our findings suggest an inflated perception of LLM representativeness in the broader community. We recommend more precise evaluation methods and comprehensive documentation of demographic attributes to ensure the responsible use of LLMs for social applications.",

However, there is mixed evidence demonstrating that teachers hold lower expectations for immigrant students. We argue that the existence and strength of this relationship may depend on the framing effect of contextual settings. To establish this, we use data from the German National Educational Panel Study and analyze (1) whether teachers’ expectations of their elementary school students are influenced by students’ immigrant background; and (2) how this effect varies with the immigrant classroom composition, local neighborhood demographics, and teachers’ own immigrant background. Using multilevel panel models, we find negative associations between students’ immigrant, particularly Turkish, background and teachers’ expectations. These associations remain significant even when accounting for students’ aspirations and performance but disappear when accounting for students’ social background. However, we observe that the negative relationship between students’ immigrant background and teachers’ expectations remains robust and stable in contexts in which the immigrant category is salient, particularly in classrooms with high concentrations of immigrant students. We conclude that both research and educational practice could benefit from taking greater account of the contextualized formation of teachers’ stereotypes.",

It is unclear whether this reflects an impact of weight on bullying, an impact of bullying on weight, or confounding by other factors. Methods: We explore the impact of BMI on workplace bullying victimization (WPB) using data from working-age participants in two large, general population surveys from Norway, the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT, N=32,826) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa mothers, N=14,076). We use genetic instrumental variable analysis to interrogate causal directionality in associations between BMI and WPB. In HUNT, we also conduct longitudinal analysis, examining whether BMI in 2006-08 predicts onset of WPB in 2017-19. Results: Participants with a higher BMI were more likely to report WPB, adjusted for confounders including socioeconomic position and psychological distress (absolute risk difference, ARD: 0.22% per kg/m2, CI: 0.13,0.31, p&lt;0.001 in HUNT, 0.22%, CI: 0.11, 0.33, p&lt;0.001 in MoBa). Genetic instrumental variable analysis found strong evidence for an impact of BMI on WPB only in MoBa (ARD: 0.65%, CI:0.06, 1.25, p=0.03 in MoBa, 0.03%, CI:-0.45,0.51, p=0.90 in HUNT). In longitudinal analyses, there was little evidence that BMI in 2006-08 affected WPB in 2017-19 (ARD: 0.01%, CI:-0.16,0.18, p=0.91), but WPB in 2006-08 was associated with slightly higher BMI in 2017-19 (0.16kg/m2, CI:0.02,0.29, p=0.02). Stratified analyses found inconsistent evidence of age, sex, and socioeconomic modification, but suggested a greater impact of BMI on WPB before 2020. Conclusions: In two large surveys from Norway, we found inconclusive evidence from genetic models that higher BMI increased risk of WPB. However, longitudinal analysis indicated that WPB affected BMI over time, consistent with an impact on BMI of psychosocial stress. Results underscore the negative consequences of WPB for physical, as well as mental, health.",

        "created": "2025-05-11",
        "abstract": "This study focuses on the core differences between traditional Chinese and mainstream Western qualitative research paradigms. Western qualitative research emphasizes empirical observation, in-depth interviews and thematic induction, and is based on social constructivism and empiricism; whereas traditional Chinese academics build a unique logic of knowledge generation by focusing on classical texts, and integrating interpretation, philosophical deduction, and hieroglyphic thinking. Through comparative analysis, this paper proposes that there are fundamental differences between the two paradigms in six dimensions: ontology, epistemology, methodology, data foundation, conclusion formation and validation criteria. The study concludes that traditional Chinese discursive paths can be regarded as an important subcategory of qualitative research, embodying a cognitive system centered on cultural inheritance, moral reasoning and internal cognition. This study emphasizes the necessity of methodological pluralism and calls for the inclusion of non-Western paradigms of knowledge production in the global academic context in order to achieve a broader theoretical integration and civilizational dialogue.",

        "abstract": "Global university rankings have transformed how certain institutions define success, often elevating metrics over meaning. This study examines universities with rapid research growth that suggest metric-driven behaviors. Among the 1,000 most publishing institutions, 98 showed extreme output increases between 2018-2019 and 2023-2024. Of these, 18 were selected for exhibiting sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. Compared to national, regional, and international norms, these universities (in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) display patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization. Key findings include publication growth of up to 965%, concentrated in STEM fields; surges in hyper-prolific authors and highly cited articles; and dense internal co-authorship and citation clusters. The group also exhibited elevated shares of publications in delisted journals and high retraction rates. These patterns illustrate vulnerabilities in global ranking systems, as metrics lose meaning when treated as targets (Goodhart’s Law) and institutions emulate high-performing peers under competitive pressure (institutional isomorphism). Without reform, rankings may continue incentivizing behaviors that distort scholarly contribution and compromise research integrity.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the development of dynamics in the Israel-Iran conflict, with a forecast for 2024, using military wisdom inspired by Sun Tzu's Art of War in combination with genetic algorithms and complexity theory. The research points out how a variety of strategies undertaken result in combat resource consumption, morale, changes in international politics, and the creation of a multisegmented simulation in war between Israel and Iran. The research methodology includes a genetic algorithm that optimizes strategies, a nonlinear interaction analysis of complexity theory, and a calculus model that simulates resource depletion and morale changes. The results indicate that the rapid strike strategy of Israel participates in short-term superiority and deteriorates logistically and in morale as the duration of the war lengthens. On the contrary, Iran can flexibly adapt to a long war of attrition by using guerrilla warfare and asymmetric warfare. The result of the study indicates that Israel's capability for combat and supply lines would be weakened by the long war strategy, and asymmetric tactics by Iran hold an even higher advantage in this type of conflict; it must serve as a reference for strategic decision-making of nations in the future when confronting similar conflicts.",

        "abstract": "Businesses, governments and other organisations are increasingly making \"nature positive\" commitments, echoing the rise of \"net-zero\" carbon pledges. These commitments are essential to achieving the global goal of having more nature in 2030 than in 2020, with ongoing recovery thereafter. They also feature prominently in emerging frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures. However, contributing meaningfully to this goal requires a clear understanding of what “nature positive” means and how it can be implemented both practically and strategically. Drawing on published literature and our experiences advising industry and government, we outline key considerations for making robust, legitimate and achievable nature positive commitments. We highlight the value of evidence-based, incremental approaches that build on existing tools such as the mitigation hierarchy and biodiversity offsetting, while progressively increasing ambition over time. Our aim is to support actors engaging with this emerging sustainability agenda by clarifying how their actions and commitments relate to the globally accepted definition of nature positive. To this end, we offer a practical checklist to help organisations lay strong foundations for effective contributions—ensuring their commitments are transparent, actionable, and deliver meaningful outcomes for both nature and the organisation.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a meta-analysis of 56 peer-reviewed studies on climate change adaptation among Nigerian farmers in West Africa. The analysis identifies five primary adaptation strategies: crop and variety diversification, water management, agroforestry, temporal adjustments, and livelihood diversification. It also highlights significant barriers to adoption, including limited access to credit, inadequate extension services, gender disparities, and cultural beliefs. The findings reveal a disconnection between the adaptation techniques modelled and the practices of farmers, often attributable to socioeconomic and institutional constraints. Notably, regional differences influence adaptation choices, with northern farmers focusing on drought-resistant crops and migration, while southern farmers prioritize flood management and soil conservation. The study underscores the importance of participatory approaches in designing effective adaptation policies that align with local contexts. By integrating scientific models with indigenous knowledge and addressing systemic barriers, policymakers can enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers to climate variability. This research contributes to climate adaptation in West Africa by providing a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature and offering insights for targeted interventions in the Nigerian agricultural sector.",

To help promote community engagement in environmental health risk assessment and management, we provide rationales and approaches. We illustrate our points with a case study concerning water reuse, as water recycling technologies expand across the U.S. and the world to address water scarcity and increased water demand, considering a community engagement continuum framework. Formal environmental risk assessment has always had a required component for public notification to seek comments, but it is arguably not meaningful community engagement, as it is often done after the risk assessment is completed (without input) and in response to contamination without multi-directional community engagement. We show how effective multi-directional engagement of the community from the beginning of the risk assessment process can help to ensure that risk assessment and management are fair and effective. We also discuss some potential obstacles to effective community engagement concerning environmental health risk assessment and management and offer some recommendations for engineers, risk assessors, and policymakers.",

        "authors": "Rochelle E. Tractenberg",
        "created": "2025-05-13",
        "abstract": "Instructors in higher education are increasingly expected to integrate emerging content—such as ethical reasoning, artificial intelligence, or data literacy—into existing courses, often without adequate support, guidance, or alignment with evidence-based practices. This paper introduces a structured and research-informed paradigm for instructor-led course redesign: Integration not Concatenation (InC). InC equips instructors to revise their own syllabi, learning outcomes, and assessments in ways that embed new material coherently and evaluably, without disrupting the cognitive architecture of their courses. The InC paradigm is grounded in two cognitive-science-informed models of change: the augmented Diffusion of Innovations (aDOI) and the augmented Theory of Change Management (aToCM). These models reframe curricular change as a cognitively demanding process and offer practical guidance for supporting instructors through message framing, knowledge transfer, alignment, and feedback. The paper details how InC operationalizes these models in a multi-phase intervention—the Hackathon of Educational Materials—that builds instructional agility, coherence, and evaluability. We synthesize research from curriculum theory, backward design, cognitive load theory, and cognitive complexity to support InC’s theoretical and practical claims. Outcomes include alignment of course elements, enhanced instructor confidence, and support for higher-order student learning. The paper concludes with implications for broader adoption, including use in faculty development, general education reform, and evidence-based instructional design. InC offers a fidelity-focused, scalable, and actionable strategy to support instructor-led change—bridging the persistent gap between educational research and pedagogical practice.",

        "abstract": "We propose a four-zone framework for understanding Information Transfer Management (ITM) in the age of advanced artificial intelligence. Drawing on the evolution of platforms like Freenet, Wikipedia, and ChatGPT, and contrasting distinct regulatory logics, the framework identifies four attractor forces—Sovereignty, Market, Morality, and Method—that shape geopolitical ITM zones. This approach is designed to support idiomatic diplomacy: forms of communication that remain tolerable even between fundamentally incompatible regimes. Such communicative capacity is essential for any jurisdiction that seeks to regulate AI services. We demonstrate the framework’s analytic utility by profiling eight thinkers—Confucius, Mao Zedong, Smith, Friedman, Montesquieu, Bourdieu, Popper, and Goodfellow—across the four zones. This leads us to propose an epistemic shift within the \"Method\" zone itself, one that relates scientific authority to the forces of power, capital, and conviction. We conclude by arguing that our framework is both empirically tractable and theoretically expandable, and offer several research questions concerning generative social phenomena that we hope others will develop further.",

However, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) suggests great potential to facilitate this process. To advance AI-assisted communication research, we examined the performance of ChatGPT (powered by GPT-4) in generating message stimuli for experimental research. Through four pre-registered experiments, we compared GPT-generated stimuli with human-generated stimuli in (1) manipulating target variables (discrete emotions and moral intuitions) and (2) controlling unintended variables. We found GPT-generated message stimuli performed equivalently to or even surpassed human-generated stimuli in manipulating target variables, while the performance in controlling unintended variables was mixed. Our study suggests that LLMs can generate effective message stimuli for communication experimental research. This research serves as a foundational resource for integrating LLMs in stimuli generation across various communication contexts, with its effectiveness, opportunities and challenges discussed.",
