        "title": "Political Jiu-Jitsu: The Effect of Organisational Structure on Backlash of Regime Repression in Nonviolent Movements",

        "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that nonviolent movements differ importantly from their violent counterparts in their dynamics and outcomes. A major – yet surprisingly understudied – mechanism for nonviolence to work is backlash of regime repression on the regime itself, what has also been coined “political jiu-jitsu”. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to research on this repression-mobilisation nexus by investigating the effect of a campaign’s organisational structure on the likelihood of backlash, understood as increased mobilisation after repression. This study uses the NAVCO 2.0 dataset, and works with a subset of annual data on over 100 nonviolent campaigns from 1945 to 2006 with maximalist goals, i.e. regime change, anti-occupation, and secession. I argue that nonviolent campaigns with a non-hierarchical organisational structure are more likely to experience increased mobilisation after repression due to their tendency to operational resilience, internal unity, adoption of new media, favourable goals, and membership diversity. Conducting a series of logistic regression analyses, I make the findings that (1) a non-hierarchical campaign structure significantly increases the likelihood of backlash, as compared to a centralised, hierarchical campaign structure. This relation holds even when controlling for campaign size and campaign year, as well as a variety of other plausible campaign characteristics. And (2) no evidence is found for interaction effects of other campaign characteristics with non-hierarchical campaign structure in its effect on backlash. This study finds an effect previously unobserved by quantitative methods, thereby contributing to an understanding of a major mechanism of nonviolent resistance. The fruitfulness of a perspective oriented on movement characteristics, especially organisational structures, for enhancing the field’s understanding is supported.",

        "abstract": "Elected officials occupy privileged positions in public communication about important topics---roles that extend to the digital world. In the same way that public officials stand to lead constructive online dialogue, they also hold the potential to accelerate the dissemination of low-factual and harmful content. This study aims to explore and explain the sharing of low-factual content by examining nearly 500,000 Facebook posts by U.S. state legislators from 2020 to 2021. We validate a widely used low-factual content detection approach in misinformation studies, and apply the measure to all of the posts we collect. Our findings reveal that the prevalence is relatively rare, affecting less than one percent of legislators' posts overall. However, Republican legislators share low-factual content at higher rates, and certain states emerge as hotspots for such content. We also find that conservative lawmakers are more likely to share such content, with this tendency potentially intensifying in conservative districts, and waning in liberal ones. Most importantly, legislative professionalism acts as a systemic constraint: lawmakers in professionalized legislatures are less likely to share low-factual content, suggesting that high professional standards curb the spread of misinformation. We conclude with a discussion of how our results present implications for future interventions to reduce the spread of low-factual content.",

We propose a framework for evaluating descriptive empirical social science, premised on the idea that descriptive research -- like all empirical social science -- should be grounded in theory. First, we articulate the social scientific purpose of description, which provides criteria for assessing descriptive questions. Good descriptive questions seek to uncover facts in need of explanation, build theory, or help to evaluate and revise theory. Second, we articulate three ideal characteristics of descriptive analyses. Good descriptive analyses are clear, comparable, and complete. Such analyses should be tightly and transparently linked to specific research questions (and thus theory), well contextualized, and as comprehensive -- in their measurement and specification -- as possible.",

        "abstract": "This article explores the geopolitical implications of China’s introduction of RMB-denominated oil futures contracts, framed through the lens of ‘power-as-autonomy’. It argues that this development marks a strategic shift in the global energy landscape, particularly within the highly dollarized oil market, where pricing and trade have historically been dominated by USD-denominated benchmarks - such as Brent and WTI. By seeking to create a parallel financial infrastructure, also manifested through these RMB-denominated oil futures contracts, China is pursuing a ‘de-dollarization’ strategy aimed at enhancing its autonomy from the United States (US). Through the examination of four key geopolitical outcomes of these RMB-denominated oil futures contracts - enhancing internationalization of the RMB, the reduction of the ‘Asian premium’ in crude oil markets, strengthened energy and financial security for China, and resistance to potential US-led sanctions - this article situates China’s efforts within the larger framework of geopolitical competition between the US and China, highlighting how this shift may reshape international trade relationships and challenges the dominance of dollarized markets.",

        "authors": "Daniel D. Reidpath",
        "created": "2025-05-19",
        "abstract": "The global human rights framework is failing—not from irrelevance, but from a lack of foundational coherence. Despite formal commitments, rights are routinely violated, fragmented by political will and conceptual fragility. Nowhere is this disjunction more evident than in global health and development, where institutional rhetoric masks systemic inertia. This paper argues that human rights lack a principled foundation, rendering them vulnerable to political manipulation, relativist erosion, and functional collapse. In response, it proposes an axiomatic approach, identifying three irreducible moral commitments—dignity, welfare, and non-expendability—as necessary and jointly sufficient to re-ground the framework. These axioms resist coercive power, protect against majoritarianism, and constrain cultural relativism, offering a structure capable of sustaining universality without imposing uniformity. Rather than relying on abstract theories or cultural consensus, this model works backward—asking what is minimally required for rights to function meaningfully across domains. The axioms clarify contested issues (e.g., abortion) and evaluate institutional legitimacy through a moral lens. They do not resolve all conflicts but render them intelligible and accountable. In a world where the international order is faltering and states increasingly reject moral constraint, these axioms offer a stable foundation for human rights to endure—even, and especially, when institutions fail.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare workers have been deliberately targeted in the Syrian conflict by the warring parties. The motives for targeted violence against health care are often diverse. Research on the topic is challenging since perpetrators are usually unable or unwilling to participate in the research. This study investigates the perpetrators' possible motives through healthcare workers' experiences and views. To protect health care in contemporary modern complex conflicts, it is essential to understand the motives of perpetrators of violence. This qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews (n = 25) with professionals who have worked in Syria between 2011 and 2017. Participants were selected using a snowball sampling method and interviewed in Turkey and Europe between 2016 and 2017. The analysis was performed using content analysis. Our results indicate that the violence conducted by GoS may aim to suppress all forms of dissent and critical voices, regardless of profession, underlining the political nature of the regime's actions. NSAGs, instead, seemed to perceive healthcare workers as valuable assets to exploit. ISIS's attitude towards HCWs was predominantly political-ideological, fostering deep suspicion and intent on punishing those participating in resistance. Both GoS and ISIS were seen to use violence against health care as part of a broader pattern targeting civilians. All warring parties were considered to distrust health care and humanitarian organizations deeply.",

        "abstract": "Science and technology (S&amp;T) are increasingly central to foreign policy, demanding institutional systems that can translate S&amp;T insight into diplomatic strategy and action. Within the U.S. Department of State, integrating S&amp;T expertise consistently across operations remains a complex challenge—one shaped more by structural limitations than by a lack of technical capacity. This paper presents a tiered and outcome-driven framework for strengthening S&amp;T advisory capacity across senior leadership, domestic bureaus and offices, and overseas embassies and posts. Improvements are organized across three operational domains—structures, processes, and tools and trainings—and designed to achieve five strategic outcomes grounded in a theory of change approach. The framework is informed by a review of past efforts to institutionalize S&amp;T within the Department and builds on lessons from previous reform reports while aligning with ongoing modernization initiatives. By linking recommendations to measurable implementation and outcome metrics, the framework provides a practical roadmap for embedding S&amp;T into the Department’s decision-making culture at scale. Strengthening S&amp;T integration is not merely a technical upgrade but a strategic shift—essential to ensuring U.S. diplomacy remains adaptive, credible, and resilient in an increasingly complex world.",

        "abstract": "What is the effect of political violence on electoral support for anti-system parties? We argue that the effect of violence is asymmetric and predominantly benefits nationalist, radical-right parties. Posing as defenders of the nation, nationalist parties benefit from violence by their political opponents and violence targeted against perceived threats to the nation. Two potential mechanisms underlie this asymmetric effect. First, nationalist violence becomes an acceptable means of defense in the eyes of status quo-oriented voters if they attribute blame to out-groups who used violence first. Second, nationalist violence itself increases the salience of a threat to the nation, and voters concerned with preserving the status quo see radical right parties as its most effective defender. To test this argument, we collect novel actor-based and geospatial data of political violence in interwar Italy. Using a difference-in-differences estimator, we model the effect of violence on vote shares of anti-system parties at the municipality-level in the 1919 and 1921 elections. Our results indicate increasing electoral support for the nationalist Fascist party in municipalities that experienced violence committed by either the far right or left after the 1919 election. In contrast, the radical left Socialist party loses electoral support if violence occurs. These results are robust to different specifications, modeling choices, and measurement approaches. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our findings for violence in liberal democracies today.",

        "abstract": "Climate change countermovements play a key role in spreading misinformation and delaying policy action. While research has primarily focused on the U.S., little is known about CCCM networks in other national contexts. Using social network analysis of the online Swedish CCCM, we 1) analyze the network’s composition and structure, 2) investigate potential hierarchical influences, where narratives flow from global think tanks to informal social media groups, and 3) identify ideological groupings within the network. Our exploratory analysis reveals four main communities, ranging from traditional climate skeptics to conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists. The alliances between these ideological groupings are not reciprocal: while climate skeptic sites receive numerous links from other groups, they predominantly link to scientific sources and international sites. The presence of this asymmetric alliance indicates that climate skeptic sites act as central hubs, channeling international CCCM discourses into Sweden, influencing and strategically aligning with various local ideological communities. By shedding light on the Swedish CCCM’s structure and dynamics, this study highlights the transnational nature of climate misinformation and its intersections with local populist and far-right networks.",

        "abstract": "Research on cultural polarization implicitly relies on two models: the spillover model, in which politics seeps into everyday life, and the consolidation model, in which everyday life is increasingly sorted into politics. These frameworks hold significant implications both for our understanding of cultural polarization, and our real-world strategies to address it. To help adjudicate between these two perspectives we examine a contemporary conservative social movement: book bans in public schools and libraries. Using vignette experiments that manipulate the social characteristics of the main characters in existing novels, our findings support the consolidation model of cultural polarization. Although Americans are inclined to judge the appropriateness of books based on the social identities of their main characters, they still generally consider stories about outgroups and rivals to be appropriate for public schools and libraries. Ideological effects are significantly attenuated by sociodemographic, psychometric, and sociometric factors that have been consolidated into parties. This suggests that even at the height of a “take-off” issue replete with consistent cueing by partisan elites and targeted campaigns by activists, popular culture remains a resource for polarized partisans, rather than a creator of them.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the impact of austerity measures implemented by the UK government after 2010 on life expectancy and mortality. We combine administrative data sources to create a panel dataset spanning from 2002 to 2019. Using a difference-indifferences strategy, we estimate the effect of cuts to welfare benefits and changes in health expenditure on life expectancy and mortality rates. Our findings indicate that these austerity measures reduced life expectancy by 2.5 to 5 months by 2019. Women were nearly twice as affected as men. The primary driver of this trend is cuts to welfare benefits, although healthcare spending changes have a larger effect per pound spent. The results suggest that austerity policies caused a three-year setback in life expectancy progress between 2010 and 2019. This is equivalent to about 190,000 excess deaths, or 3 percent of all deaths. Taking into account the years of life lost, we conclude that the costs of austerity significantly exceeded the benefits derived from reduced public expenditure.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between natural disasters and emigration from Haiti to the United States, focusing on the moderating role of political instability. Haiti is one of the most disaster-prone and politically fragile countries in the Western Hemisphere, experiencing an average of 3.1 disasters per year between 1990 and 2020. Drawing on thirty years of national-level time series data, this study employs a linear Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model with interaction terms to test whether political instability amplifies the migration response to disasters. The results reveal a strong and statistically significant link between disaster frequency and emigration flows. Moreover, this relationship is significantly intensified in years of heightened political instability, suggesting that weak institutional capacity compounds the push factors associated with natural shocks. While traditional migration models emphasize economic drivers, this study shows that political stability plays a crucial role in shaping emigration outcomes. These findings highlight the need for integrated policy responses that address both environmental risks and governance challenges in disaster-prone settings.",

We then apply it to a global database of commercial policy descriptions and quantify policy use at the country, industry, and year levels (2009-2020). These data allow us to study fundamental policy patterns across the world. We highlight four findings. First, IP is common (25% of policies in our database) and has expanded since 2010. Second, instead of blunt tariffs, IP is granular and technocratic. Countries tend to use subsidies and export promotion measures, often targeted at individual firms. Third, the countries engaged most in IP tend to be wealthier (top income quintile) liberal democracies. In our data, IP is rarer among the poorest nations (bottom quintile). Fourth, IP is targeted toward a subset of industries and is highly correlated with an industry’s revealed comparative advantage. We show that industrial policy is a prominent feature of the global economy and a far cry from industrial policies of the past.",

Framing the MBTI has a cultural item or meme, we explore it and the subculture that has emerged around it on Chinese social media. We rely on a symbolic interactionist conception of cultural creation to show how the MBTI became known (K), useable (U), functional (F), appropriate (A), and triggered (T) on social media platforms, and how it circulates within a network of young Chinese social media users. Our analysis highlights the memetic spread of MBTI among Chinese millennials and Gen Zs in terms of a contemporary Chinese social media subculture that facilitates and supports the development and expression of non-traditional self-conceptions and identities. Using the MBTI not only provides opportunities for desirable presentations of self, but also simplifies definitions of self and other and thus helps streamline interactions among youths.",

Data from 1554 participants in Spain (n = 782) and the United States (n = 772) were analyzed regarding narrative transportation, realism, identification, enjoyment, and parasocial interaction. The findings suggest that extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness positively influence emotional and cognitive engagement with deepfakes, whereas neuroticism reduces enjoyment and connection. NFC enhances engagement with complex content, particularly in political deepfakes, whereas NFA strengthens emotional engagement, especially in entertainment deepfakes. U.S. participants exhibit higher cognitive and emotional responses than their Spanish counterparts, suggesting that cultural context moderates the impact of individual variables. These findings highlight the interplay between personality traits, NFC, and NFA in shaping deepfake reception, and emphasize the need to consider cultural factors in future research.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates how interethnic contact influences partner preferences, focusing on the phenomenon of deprovincialization, the idea that contact with ethnic out-groups leads not only to improved attitudes toward others but also a reevaluation of one’s own in-group. While previous research hints at the effect of contact in intermarriage behavior, studies have yet to explore how contact shapes individual preferences, and whether effects are universal or group specific. Using a conjoint experiment with 1,364 unmarried Japanese participants, I examine how both structural and individual-level contact with foreigners affect evaluations of hypothetical marriage candidates of different nationalities. Results show that exposure is linked to reduced preference for co-ethnic Japanese candidates, consistent with the deprovincialization hypothesis. However, openness to foreign candidates varies by nationality. Contact is associated with increased acceptance of some groups, but not others and in some cases even reinforces negative views. These findings extend contact theory into the domain of intimate preferences, giving insight into how partner preferences are socially shaped rather than fixed.",

This study constructs a biodiversity risk index for 155 countries and regions spanning the years 2001 to 2019, analysing how international tourism influences biodiversity risks in destination countries. The results indicate that the growth of international tourism significantly elevates biodiversity risks, with these effects displaying both lagging and cumulative characteristics. Furthermore, spatial analysis shows that international tourism also intensifies biodiversity risks in neighbouring countries. The extent of its impact varies according to the tourism model and destination. In addition, government regulations and international financial assistance play a crucial role in mitigating the biodiversity risks associated with international tourism.",

Yet, there are few examples of studies evaluating both the technical and ethical aspects of such applications. Here, we provide a nation-scale worked example that combines machine learning and publicly available data to predict spatial patterns of Community Forestry establishment among 539,221 settlements across Zambia. Our model accurately predicted out-of-sample spatial establishment patterns nearly three-quarters of the time (balanced accuracy = 76.5%, sensitivity = 64.0%, specificity = 89.1%), though had a high false positive rate (precision of 24.3%). Accurately forecasting conservation establishment patterns requires better data on local preferences and programmatic decision-making. Furthermore, such artificial intelligence applications risk making decision-making more technocratic, top-down, and opaque, so they should only inform deliberation over possible future scenarios within wider multistakeholder landscape governance processes.",

It aims to characterize the online attention received by the topic through an analysis of mentions on the channels covered by the platform, as well as to assess the most common types of production, which journals or collections this production is linked to, the period in which the mentions occurred and which productions are most relevant in this context. Exploratory research with altmetric analysis, using the Altmetric.com platform in its Altmetric Explorer advanced search option, with an institutional key previously provided. The following filters were used: publisher, journal, affiliation, DOI, Orcid, funding agency, subject area, keywords, etc. The collection was carried out on February 11, 2025, with a survey carried out using keyword queries with the term \"deepseek\". The results obtained were exported in xls format and the data was analyzed for general altmetric impact information, such as the number of outputs tracked, the total number of mentions, the journals and repositories in which the most mentioned articles were published, the highest number of mentions, the period in which these mentions took place and the channels with the highest number of mentions. The results showed 45 research outputs since the first publications were tracked (January 2024). A total of 5,237 mentions were tracked by the platform, an average of 116.3 mentions for each search output. The first mention was in January 2024, on X, the channel where the topic began to receive attention online and remained the most relevant throughout the period. It was found that the topic has at least one mention in a variety of channels on the social web, demonstrating a significant interest from different audiences in the topic, both scientific and non-scientific. The most traditional journals are the main vehicles for publishing research, with arXiv being the first repository with the highest number of mentions (2987), followed by Nature (1498). The three most mentioned articles had at least 1000 mentions, and the first most mentioned article was published in December 2024, while the other two were published in January 2025. The conclusion is that DeepSeek has gained significant attention online, reflecting its growing relevance in the contemporary scientific and technological landscape.",

This study investigates the internal mobility preferences of Syrian refugees in Turkey and Germany. Adopting a multi-method approach, we conducted a choice-based conjoint experiment with over 3,000 participants and a content analysis of qualitative survey data. The results of the experimental survey reveal that local attitudes and policies are more significant in shaping refugees’ destination preferences than economic factors and social ties. Additionally, the results of the content analysis demonstrate that Syrian refugees associate anti-immigrant local policies and attitudes primarily with exclusion, social isolation, discrimination, and heightened anxiety. Many refugees fear that such conditions and experiences may prevent them from developing a strong sense of belonging, leading them to avoid localities with restrictive policies and hostile attitudes. Our findings also demonstrate a strong deterrent effect of anti-immigration policies and discourses. From both normative and policy perspectives, we conclude that inclusive local policies and attitudes are essential for promoting refugees’ integration and psychosocial well-being.",

        "abstract": "Wars are often measured by the number of lives lost and political change, but the damage they cause to our environment; land, water, air, and wildlife, are equally severe. While the environmental impacts of wars or armed conflicts have been widely studied, the effects of low-intensity and protracted social and political conflicts have not received as much attention, despite their far-reaching and often overlooked ecological consequences. India’s landscapes have been profoundly shaped by centuries of environmental change, much of which stem from a history of colonial exploitation and subsequent conflict and resistance. This paper presents a chronological analysis of the ecological consequences of low-intensity and protracted conflicts in India, beginning with the environmental legacy of British colonialism. The colonial era brought about extensive deforestation, the expansion of monoculture plantations, and the arrival of invasive species; changes all propelled by the British Empire’s economic goals and strategic ambitions. These shifts disrupted traditional land use practices, displaced indigenous communities, and laid the groundwork for many of the ecological crises India faces today. In the postcolonial period, the environmental landscape continued to be shaped by new forms of disruption: militarization in the Himalayas, armed insurgencies in regions like the Red Corridor and the North East, and growing resistance movements led by Adivasi communities in places such as Jharkhand and Kerala. Each of these phases has left lasting ecological footprints, from the breaking up of habitats and species loss, to the erosion of long-standing systems of environmental stewardship. These developments reveal how deeply today’s environmental challenges are rooted in India’s colonial legacy and the enduring struggles of its marginalized communities.",

        "created": "2025-05-19",
        "abstract": "This article seeks to understand the role of storage for social time. While social theory has largely interpreted storage in spatial terms, a recent body of literature explores how cold storage technologies affect society’s relationship with time. The ability to suspend life in ice, several scholars argue, leads to a new relationship with time: the future becomes malleable as frozen cells, tissues and seeds are options with which events can be reversed, action can be postponed, and the status quo can be preserved. However, a growing number of empirical studies of cold storage complicates this hypothesis, finding that these technologies are often used to accelerate action instead. The divergence, this article argues, can be understood by linking the assumptions underlying the suspension hypothesis to sociological concepts like value, expectations, and especially practice. It argues that under certain circumstances, storage is best understood as dynamic rather than static. Taking in things and releasing them at different rates, it acts as a form of buffer that can link social activity and flows of different speeds and rhythms without imposing a shared temporality on them. On these grounds, the article pleads for a broadened understanding of storage as a social technique that affects both space and time.",

        "abstract": "Since ancient times, humanity's relentless pursuit of knowledge has been a defining attribute of our species. As AI capabilities rapidly accelerate, the relationship between human learning and machine intelligence has reached an inflection point. Our antiquated education systems now stand at a crossroads, where technology offers potential to redefine the fundamental nature of learning. This dissertation argues that the rise of AI necessitates a reimagining of education, shifting away from rote knowledge acquisition to instead creativity, emotional intelligence, and lifelong curiosity—the qualities that make us intrinsically human. Human labor faces its own AI-induced metamorphosis. As algorithms automate tasks and enhance productivity, we must reexamine the deeper meaning and value of work in a society increasingly permeated by intelligent machines. What becomes of the dignity, satisfaction, and sense of purpose humans have long derived from their labors? This dissertation will investigate the social, economic, and philosophical implications of an AI-transformed labor market through an interdisciplinary lens spanning fields from anthropology and cognitive science to economics. This study contends that rather than training workers for specific skills, the schools of the future should prioritize nurturing self-directed learning and engaged citizens who can thrive in a workplace shared with AI. If education is reoriented toward cultivating humanity's unique aptitudes, we can build a future where both human and machine intelligence reach their full potential in collaboration. This outlook provides a compass to guide education leaders in adapting to an automated, AI-driven world where the meanings of learning and labor continue to evolve.",

In Sri Lanka, an internal conflict between 1989 and 2009 displaced many rural residents. Muthur residents were forced to evacuate in 2006 and returned in 2014 on average after prolonged displacement. In this study, we aim to identify the constraints on agriculture in post-conflict settings and the roles of governments and aid donors in enhancing the recovery of their livelihoods. Through semi-structured interviews with Muthur farmers, we found conflict-induced constraints, such as deterioration in human capital, destruction of storage facilities, confusion of land ownership, constrained paddy cultivation, along with other agricultural constraints. Addressing land ownership issues and providing financial compensation are crucial for enhancing livelihood recovery in such cases. However, in intrastate conflicts, the role of the government in leading reconstruction is problematic. If land ownership issues are not resolved, development projects can harm their livelihoods.",

Together, these processes resulted in what we conceptualize as platform illiberalism, an emerging regime whereby illiberal-esque logics reshape speech control internally while supporting illiberal actors externally.

        "abstract": "Peer review has long been regarded as a cornerstone of scholarly communication, ensuring high quality and credibility of published research. However, its institutionalization in the mid-20th century contrasts sharply with the 300-year history of academic journals. By the early 21st century, there emerged an opinion that the conventional model of peer review faces systematic challenges, including inefficiency, bias, and institutional inertia. The study aims to synthesize the evolution, practices, and outcomes of both conventional and innovative peer review models in scholarly publishing. Through a mixed-methods approach combining interpretative literature review and process modeling (BPMN), it identifies four frameworks: pre-publication peer review, registered reports, modular publishing, and the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. While the PRC model, which integrates preprints with post-publication review, demonstrates advantages in transparency and accessibility, no single approach emerges as universally ideal. The choice of model depends on disciplinary context, resource availability, and institutional priorities. The analysis underscores the need for adaptable platforms that enable hybrid workflows, balancing rigor with inclusivity. Future research must address empirical gaps in evaluating these innovations, particularly their long-term impact on equity and epistemic norms.",

        "abstract": "Geotagged social media data have emerged as a rich source of insight about spatial dimensions of social phenomena. This methodological article exploits a unique dataset that combines geotagged social media content and home and work locations collected from social media users through a survey to compare three methods of assigning home locations from geotagged social media: majority voting, time frame clustering, and a novel method using activity spaces created from users’ geotagged posts. Using exact match accuracy as the measure, the basic majority voting method achieved better high estimates for both current and previous home location predictions compared to the time frame clustering method. However, for work location prediction, time frame clustering showed better accuracy, and the activity space method contained 25.3% of true home and 44.4% of true work locations. The study found lower precision than others and highlights accuracy trade-offs among each option for assigning home or work locations from geotagged social media.",

        "abstract": "There are numerous calls to revise the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to make them more attainable, but how governments can achieve this remains debated. Suggestions for SDG implementation often focus on enhanced governance models, with civil society holding governments accountable for sustainability commitments. This paper, through the lens of poverty relief via SDG1 and SDG2, advocates for a practice-oriented approach that enables deprived communities to leverage the SDGs for political gain. We argue that the poor can hold governments accountable through critical peer discourse, which refers to the exchange of critical views within communities about public policy. While critical peer discourse often generates a passive political space with limited influence on government politics, it can become a space of governmental accountability when customized around SDG1 and SDG2 indicators. To this end, a roadmap for organizing critical peer discourse is developed through controlling governmental data and informal language games with communities.",

        "abstract": "The race to professorship is influenced by many factors, ranging from individual achievements to systemic structures. Prior research has underscored the significance of aspects such as academic productivity, institutional affiliations, and personal choices in shaping academic careers, but comprehensive analyses in specific contexts remain limited. The last two decades have seen strategic shifts within the German academic system, most notably with the introduction of junior and tenure-track professorships intended to offer a more secure career path. Yet, uncertainties persist regarding the determinants of career trajectories to tenured university professorship. Addressing this gap, this paper uses unique and novel longitudinal data of German professors to elucidate the various pathways to professorship. Based on a sample of individuals who successfully secured full university professorship, we estimate comprehensive models using machine learning to determine relevant factors that predict the time needed to reach this position. Key correlates are obtaining a habilitation, having held positions with leadership responsibilities, and disciplinary fields.",

        "abstract": "Making Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in government work for the benefit of citizens hinges on functional properties such as their performance and transparency. However, the proliferation of these systems also amounts to a transformative change through which citizens face an increasingly algorithmic state. This makes it important to shift the view from AI systems themselves toward the changing quality of the citizen-state relationship. This article highlights the importance of a social-relational dimension of government AI uses for understanding how they can be problematic even when producing material benefits for citizens. It combines social recognition theory with institutionalist arguments to develop an integrative account of how AI use can reduce the institutionalized expression of respect toward citizens – and how this differs by setting of AI deployment. The framework provides a coherent approach for conceptualizing both moral implications of government AI use and non-instrumental evaluative criteria regarding citizens’ perceptions of these uses.",

        "created": "2025-05-18",
        "abstract": "Introduction. Effective clinical communication in culturally and linguistically diverse contexts is essential for high-quality and equitable patient care. However, it remains challenging to teach at scale. This study introduces a novel generative AI (GenAI) platform, trained with a new Culturally Competent Communication (CCC) Guide, that can offer additional learning opportunities for students. Methods. The AI platform can simulate consultations and give students structured feedback based on the CCC Guide. A qualitative survey was used to capture fifteen third-year medical students’ experience learning with the AI platform, which was then thematically analysed. Results. The results show that the feedback based on the CCC Guide was effective in developing students’ culturally competent communication strategies. The CCC Guide offers a practical framework for clinical practice and educational interventions. The AI platform provides students with a safe and flexible space for practice. It can allow students and teachers to track and personalise learning. Discussion. This innovative approach provides another solution to the evolving trend in medical education, which is moving away from high-stakes summative assessments toward more continuous formative evaluations and blended learning strategies. The findings also pose a critical argument that GenAI tools should serve as complementary to, rather than a replacement for, human-led training.",
