        "created": "2025-11-18",
        "abstract": "The 2025 shift from Biden’s Democratic to Trump’s Republican administration led to a relevant change in US strategy for the war in Ukraine. Models of democratic responsiveness imply that this would also be reflected in divergent preferences among US partisan voters regarding the normative, strategic, and economic considerations connected to supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Do voters on the political left and right resolve these trade-offs differently? We bring conjoint and vignette survey experiments with 2,334 US citizens to this question. We show that absolute levels of support for Ukraine are lower among Republicans. However, irrespective of partisanship, citizens resolve the fundamental trade-offs involved in Ukraine policy similarly. Average support is higher for strategies that sustain the territorial integrity and political sovereignty of Ukraine compared to concessions to Russia -- even if less strongly so among (moderate) US Republicans. Both Democrat and Republican voters show relevant concern for the human costs of war, domestic economic costs, and escalation risk -- with economic costs resonating more among Republicans. Our results imply, tentatively, that differences in partisan preferences are smaller than the US administrations’ drawback of Ukraine support would let expect. Overall, for a case where normative motivations for intervention loom large, public support is not structured as expected along the left-right axis.",

        "authors": "Michael A. Strebel",
        "created": "2025-11-19",
        "abstract": "Local governments in many countries struggle to find candidates for elected office. In the resulting uncontested elections, voters cannot choose between different candidates and hold local representatives accountable. Amalgamation might be a solution for this challenge to democracy since larger jurisdictions need fewer elected officials per voter. Combining data on all Swiss local government mergers in the 21st century with data on local executive elections, this article assesses whether amalgamation reforms indeed increase candidate supply and hence local electoral contestation. Staggered difference-in-differences regressions show that amalgamation increases the number of candidates/seat. The underlying mechanisms seem to go beyond a ``mechanical'' effect that results from a mere expansion of the candidate pool. This study, thus, provides first empirical evidence that local government amalgamation might contribute to mitigate a hidden supply side crisis of electoral democracy at the local level.",

        "created": "2025-11-17",
        "abstract": "Despite the growing prominence of traditionalist values—often rooted in religion—within moral-conservative mobilizations, research on religious social media users and their political engagement remains limited. This study employs computational methods to examine the prevalence, composition, partisanship, content production, and reposting behavior of religious users in abortion-related Twitter discourse during Italy’s 2022 general elections. Findings reveal that religious users constitute a small but vocal minority, overrepresented among media, political, and influencer accounts, potentially amplifying their visibility. Their partisanship aligns with right-wing parties, yet engagement with mainstream political leaders is lower than average, possibly due to selective curation and limited resonance with party messaging. Their content also includes misinformation linking vaccines to abortion, reinforcing moral-conservative narratives. These results advance understanding of religious users as political actors in networked public spheres and demonstrate the value of computational approaches for empirically analyzing religion’s role in online political communication.",

        "authors": "Phil Swatton",
        "created": "2025-11-19",
        "abstract": "Empirical political science generates knowledge of the world through abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation. However, to date, no attempt has been made to compare the explanatory quality of the sociological modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the socio-economic positions of voters, and the spatial modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the ideology of voters. I argue that the paradigm of predictive inference, or machine learning, offers three contributions towards comparing these traditions within the abductive framework of political science. This depends on a change in emphasis, from seeking to produce maximally predictive models according a given metric to treating the predictive power of well-chosen variables as a theoretically interesting quantity. Taking the 2019 UK general election and 2019 EU parliament election as my primary and secondary case studies respectively, I use supervised machine learning to compare models using demographic variables and ideological variables to predict vote choice. Using British Election Study data I find that models using demographic variables are not much more accurate than assuming all voters vote for the largest party. I find that models using ideological variables perform better, but even these models struggle to predict third party vote choice. Using European Election Study data from 15 countries, I confirm that this result generalises, albeit there is too much uncertainty to confirm it in any particular country. I perform some post-hoc analysis using mutual information and PCA to give further support to my evidence. To my knowledge, this is the first time mutual information has been used to study vote choice. I conclude by arguing that in line with the three contributions my evidence shows that the spatial modelling tradition represents a better explanation in the abductive reasoning framework, and highlight several promising directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Donald Trump’s sophisticated use of speech manipulation strategies has inspired numerous research studies. O.I. Nazarenko and O.Ye. Nesterenko (2023) looked beyond Donald Trump at the Republican Party at large and found a pattern of manipulative effect in Republican discourse supporting Russia in the Russian-Ukrainian war. This raises many important questions for researchers. What is the political motivation for Republicans to side with Russia against Ukraine? How did this come to be? To answer these questions, this article presents the first recorded history of speech manipulation in Republican discourse. The investigation traced the origin of speech manipulation in Republican discourse to conservative principles introduced by William F. Buckley Jr. and Barry Goldwater. Critical discourse analysis identified manipulative strategies and techniques and revealed hidden messages and motivations connected across speakers and generations. This work supports the need for further speech manipulation research from a historical perspective.",

        "abstract": "Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is widely used to estimate opinion in small sub- groups and to adjust unrepresentative surveys. Yet, even flexible MRP models contain errors generated by non-response and model misspecification. We propose a principled, data-driven method to leverage observable errors on auxiliary quantities with known marginal distributions — e.g., election outcomes — to improve estimates of policy attitudes. Our method leverages the correlation between auxiliary variables and outcomes of interest to calibrate MRP estimates to these known marginal distributions. We illustrate our approach using a pre-election poll measuring support for an abortion referendum. We find that the method reduces county-level error by two-thirds relative to traditional MRP. We also show how our calibration approach can be used to generate estimates for smaller nested geographies, such as precincts, even in the absence of poststratification data at this level. Our approach provides a framework for fully incorporating known population data to improve estimates of public opinion in small subgroups, providing scholars another tool to study representation.",

        "created": "2025-11-20",
        "abstract": "Climate change adaptation (CCA) increasingly relies on collaborative efforts to generate and circulate actionable knowledge. Among these, knowledge networks (KNs) have emerged as key infrastructures for fostering transnational cooperation, enabling mutual learning, and supporting local implementation. While their theoretical value is widely acknowledged, the empirical landscape of adaptation-related knowledge networks in Europe remains poorly understood. This article offers the first systematic mapping of KNs working on CCA in Europe, with a particular focus on Transnational Municipal Networks (TMNs)—a prominent subset composed primarily of local authorities. We identify and compare 32 knowledge networks across key dimensions including structure, governance, membership, funding models, and core activities. The analysis is grounded in two original datasets: a network-level dataset comprising 32 adaptation-related KNs and a membership-level dataset encompassing over 17,000 entries, systematically collected and geo-referenced. These resources provide an unprecedented empirical basis for understanding how climate knowledge is shared, institutionalised, and mobilised across Europe. Our findings reveal a diverse and uneven landscape, with significant variation in access thresholds, support mechanisms, and geographic representation. TMNs, in particular, differ in the type and intensity of support they provide—ranging from technical expertise and financial assistance to symbolic capital and peer learning opportunities. The article contributes to ongoing debates about multilevel climate governance and the role of networks in enhancing local adaptation capacity.",

        "abstract": "The 2003 U.S.-led invasion fundamentally reshaped Iraq’s political and economic hierarchies, overturning dec ades of Sunni dominance and redistributing access to state resources along new sectarian lines. This study offers the first quantitative analysis of anti-Americanism in Iraq, theorizing sectarian identity and economic standing as joint predictors of attitudes towards the United States. I use four nested ordered logistic models and data from two Arab Barometer Waves (2021-2024) to assess Iraqis’ attitudes two decades after the invasion. The results show that economic deprivation and sectarian identity on their own are not enough to drive anti-Americanism. However, their interaction is—economic status substantively lowers anti-Americanism for Sunnis and marginally strengthens it among Shiites. Moreover, regional differences—most notably Baghdad’s high hostility—underline the contextual variation of anti-American sentiment in Iraq.",

        "abstract": "Mobile apps earn revenues from multiple sources, including download prices, in-app purchases, and advertisements. The presence of multiple revenue sources creates the channel through which business parameter changes affect app developers' choice of revenue sources, which may overturn standard price and advertisement pass-through effects. To capture this revenue-source channel, we propose an empirical model of mobile app competition wherein app developers choose download prices, usage prices, and in-app advertising intensities. We employ a competition-in-utility approach to offer a tractable characterization of developers' revenue source choices. We estimate the model using Google Play roleplaying game data from Japan over 2015--2017 and use the estimated model to show the effects of app mergers and changes in transaction fees, highlighting the importance of the revenue-source channel.",

        "authors": "Mario Coccia",
        "created": "2025-11-19",
        "abstract": "This study examines mortality dynamics across major macroeconomic regions—Western countries, non-Western regions, and China—from 1960 to 2023, exploring variability and underlying drivers. Descriptive analysis shows that non-Western regions experienced the highest death rates in 1960–1990, followed by a marked decline as GDP per capita increased. China exhibited a similar pattern. Conversely, Western countries achieved only modest mortality reductions after 1991 despite sustained economic growth, even when controlling for population aging (≥65 years). Regression models and partial correlations indicate that economic progress initially correlates with mortality decline in all regions. However, in Western countries, this relationship reverses after 1991, forming an inverted-U curve when mortality is modeled against GDP per capita and elderly share. This suggests diminishing health returns and potential adverse effects of advanced development—such as environmental degradation, lifestyle-related diseases, and occupational risks. Non-Western regions, with slower economic acceleration, show no comparable reversal. Findings imply that beyond a development threshold, further growth may paradoxically elevate mortality. Policy strategies should prioritize balanced, sustainable development and integrated “One Health” approaches to mitigate health risks associated with over-rapid economic expansion.",

The paper uses real operative data for developing and validating a complete analytical tool to forecast volume saturation on pallets. Compared to other studies on similar matters, which frequently make use of simulated and ideal sets of data, this research provides a unique opportunity to test, on an empirical ground, how very advanced Data Science approaches could be successfully applied on industrial processes.The paper develops a complete analytical investigation combining diagnose analytics, forecasting and model-interpretability to compare the performances of many different Machine Learning algorithms, such us K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Linear Models. The results obtained after an overarching comparison show how KNN is significantly more accurate and trustful in relation to any other method, outperforming any other on any key error measure and interpretability factors. The addition of contribution and importance investigation on variables extends to this paper a unique degree of originality, showing which SKUs’ physical variables are most significantly influencing volume saturation on pallets, and offering immediate management implications related to their operative meaning. The complete methodological pipeline is grounded on real operative data regarding La Logistica S.r.l., making this paper capable to show how operative Data-Driven solutions could play an innovative role into improving operative continuity within logistics matters.",

        "abstract": "Traditional retailing has undergone a profound transformation driven by shifting consumer expectations, an increase in e-commerce, and growing demand for immersive shopping environments. Experiential marketing has emerged as a strategic approach aimed at creating memorable, multisensory, and emotionally engaging retail experiences. Rather than focusing solely on products and transactions, experiential retailing emphasizes sensory stimulation, emotional connection, aesthetic design, and interactive participation, which collectively influence customer satisfaction, engagement, and loyalty. Prior research highlights that hedonic and utilitarian motivations, environmental cues, and holistic experience design significantly shape consumer behavior within retail settings. This study synthesizes key theoretical perspectives on experiential marketing and examines their implications for the redesign of physical retail spaces. Experience-based strategies have become essential for retailers seeking differentiation and a sustained competitive advantage in an increasingly digital marketplace.",

        "created": "2025-11-18",
        "abstract": "Using Italian microdata, this paper documents that, conditional on parental resources, education, and transfers, (i) expecting an inheritance predicts a 19.6 percentage points (63.5%) higher probability of university enrollment, and (ii) expected heirs tend to belong to altruistic dynasties, since having received an inheritance nearly doubles the intention to leave a bequest. I rationalize these findings with a stylized model where dynastic altruism underpins expected heirs’ stronger bequest motives. They accumulate human capital to increase lifetime income, hence the ability to finance bequests. The quantitative model attributes 44% of the gap in student rates between expected heirs and the rest to dynastic bequest motives, 35% to coresidence with parents and inter vivos transfers, whereas the expected wealth transfer itself has a strong negative effect on education. Policy counterfactuals show that inheritance taxation raises enrollment, especially when it funds student grants, and that the link between inheritance expectations and education is stronger when the discounted returns to education are lower. These findings help explain intergenerational persistence in education, wealth, and income, and highlight how inheritance taxation can affect the level and composition of human capital.

        "abstract": "Geopolitical risk has emerged as a persistent feature of the global business environment, yet its impacts on domestic mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) remain underexplored, particularly in emerging economies with distinctive institutional contexts. This study examines how geopolitical risk influences M&amp;A deal failure in India and whether acquirers’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) moderates this relationship under the country’s mandatory CSR regime. Using a sample of 377 domestic M&amp;A deals announced between 2015–16 and 2019–20, the analysis reveals a counterintuitive pattern: higher geopolitical risk is associated with a lower likelihood of deal failure, suggesting that firms pursue domestic consolidation as a defensive hedge against external volatility. While acquirers’ CSR performance independently reduces the probability of deal failure, its interaction with high geopolitical risk increases the likelihood of failure. It indicates that strong CSR commitments may constrain financial flexibility during uncertain times, thereby heightening deal vulnerability. These results remain robust across alternative model specifications, sub-samples, and disaggregated geopolitical risk measures. By integrating geopolitical risk with a legally enforced CSR spending regime, this study provides one of the first empirical demonstrations of how macro-political turbulence and regulatory social responsibility jointly shape corporate M&amp;A outcomes in emerging markets. These findings re-conceptualize CSR as a potential financial constraint under regulation and advance the understanding of firm behavior at the intersection of risk, responsibility, and regulation.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the impact of the nationwide suspension of nuclear power plants following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident, as well as the subsequent restart of the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima Prefecture, on local socio-economic structures. Using municipal-level statistics for 2010, 2014, and 2020, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to extract the underlying patterns of regional socio-economic organization. In addition, difference-in-differences (DID) regression analysis was employed to evaluate the effects of plant proximity on municipal fiscal indicators. The findings reveal that in 2010, urban scale and plant location were the primary axes of differentiation; by 2014, however, the suspension accentuated demographic and fiscal vulnerabilities across municipalities. In 2020, even after the plant restart, the structure of urban dominance and peripheral stagnation persisted, with widening disparities. The DID analysis further suggests that the fiscal benefits of the restart were limited and unevenly distributed. This study contributes to the literature by quantitatively and spatially assessing the dynamic impacts of exogenous shocks on regional societies, while highlighting both the risks of nuclear dependence and the pressing policy challenge of mitigating regional inequality.",

        "abstract": "Much AI risk discourse centers on loss of control under AGI. We ask a nearer question: before those thresholds, does modern machine learning already create a structural risk for how societies produce knowledge and culture? We use temporality in an operational sense: the way understanding changes over time and the signals left by that process. Representation learning and large-scale autoregressive generation approximate the distribution of task outputs like text, designs and decisions while omitting the slow, path-dependent human learning that produced them; at scale, these pipelines function as general-purpose production technologies. We formalize the link from technical indistinguishability to market selection with a GAN-inspired economic model and a screening threshold: when divergence between model signals and temporal signals is small and verification remains costly, decision makers cease screening, prices track pooled quality, and temporality-intensive work exits. We call this value collapse. As training data increasingly mirror such environments, models absorb their own outputs and the risk of model collapse rises through loss of diversity and feedback. Alignment is, in our model, largely orthogonal: by improving usability and narrowing observable gaps, it can reduce incentives to screen and thereby intensify these selection pressures, especially where provenance remains costly to verify. This integration of machine learning and economic reasoning clarifies conditions under which signals and rewards are reshaped.",

        "abstract": "Kate’s House Foundation operates and owns seven accredited MAT homes serving justice-involved adults referred by the Drug Court and the Department of Corrections (DOC). The program emphasizes trauma-informed care, no rapid-exit policies, and prohibits resident “vote-outs.” Because all participants were justice-involved at entry, the realistic alternative to remaining in housing was the possibility of losing drug court benefits or returning to jail or prison for relapse or non-compliance. Within this high-risk context, the longer lengths of stay observed in this cohort represent extended periods in the community in lieu of incarceration, underscoring the preventive impact of a non-punitive, stabilization-first recovery housing model. We evaluated early exits, length of stay (LOS), completion/active status, employment change, and age patterns using assessments at ~0, 45, and 90 days (REC-CAP). 10, 12. Mean LOS was ~141 days (median ~97), and among residents engaged beyond 30 days the mean LOS was 181 days. Using LOS ≥60 days as a priori “engagement success,” retention was strongest among older adults, while residents &lt;25 showed the weakest ≥60-day retention. 5, 6 REC-CAP Social Capital &amp; Meaningful Activities scores skewed high (94% scoring 4–5 on a 5-point scale across 394 responses), indicating substantial perceived connection and purposeful activity during residence. Uniquely, this large single-system cohort spans seven houses run by one foundation under consistent policies, with data collected by two trained staff—reducing site-level variability common in multi-operator studies. In this cohort, Drug Court participants achieved retention patterns similar to DOC participants, supporting the role of non-punitive, MAT-compatible housing in maintaining community placement across justice-system categories.",

        "abstract": "This study explores interactions between ransomware victims and offenders through a qualitative analysis of chat negotiations of the LockBit ransomware group (n=147), providing insight into data exfiltration, extortion, communication and negotiation, payment, and post-payment outcomes. The findings show that both offenders and victims employ bounded rational decision-making. For offenders, this is exemplified by aspects such as tailor-made ransom demands for each victim and balancing between trust signals and pressure tactics. For victims, this includes aspects such as the reasoning behind the decision to negotiate and pay a ransom demand, considering for example, the financial situation of their company, value of the data, and time and effort required to recover without a decryptor. However, both parties also have to deal with information asymmetry, including offenders having incomplete information on the victim’s finances or the value of the data, or victims being unsure about the credibility of the ransomware group. The findings also illustrate the interplay between both parties in shaping the outcome of the ransomware attack, and the professional aspects and imperfections of LockBit’s ransomware operations. The study highlights the importance of understanding victim-offender interactions during ransomware attacks, while also providing practical implications for the support of victims.",

        "abstract": "The American Dream has long symbolized opportunities and upward mobility for migrants. Migration research often assumes that migrants in European countries hold imaginaries similar to the American Dream, yet recent scholarship on the role of the institutional context challenges this assumption. This study examines how migrants in Germany—a context with a different institutional setup—envision their destination. Based on interviews and group discussions with 47 migrants residing in Germany, this study identifies the contours of a distinct “German Dream”. Participants portrayed Germany as an institutional counterpoint to the United States, describing it as a “caring society” characterized by low inequality and extensive welfare provisions. This study makes three contributions to the study of geographical imaginaries. First, it demonstrates how imaginaries are relationally constructed by showing how migrants construct the German Dream through comparisons with the American Dream. Second, it highlights how different institutional contexts foster distinct imaginaries. Third, it emphasizes how imaginaries convey a vision of the good society, showing that migrants evaluate not only their own prospects but also the broader social order.",

        "abstract": "Research on gene–environment interactions in education focuses on two main hypotheses: the compensatory advantage hypothesis, holding that genetic disadvantage would be less consequential in resource-rich environments, and the Scarr–Rowe hypothesis, based on the idea that the availability of resources can reinforce a genetic advantage. Although regression approaches frame these as mutually exclusive, the underlying theoretical expectations concern differences at the extremes of the genetic distribution, as measured by a polygenic index (PGI). Here compensation and reinforcing dynamics are mapped to socioeconomic (SES) differences in the rate of overachievers (low-PGI individuals who attain a degree) and underachievers (high-PGI individuals who do not). Using three representative datasets from the US and UK, the findings show that compensatory and reinforcing dynamics can operate simultaneously: high-SES students are more likely to overachieve despite a low PGI - suggesting compensation - and less likely to underachieve - supporting Scarr-Rowe hypothesis. This framework challenges the presumed trade-off between equity and efficiency, and, in reconciling longstanding hypotheses on GxE interactions, possibly explains inconsistent findings from the literature.",

        "abstract": "Can large-scale geopolitical shocks causally reshape how individuals perceive their intergenerational mobility? We address this question by examining the immediate impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on mobility perceptions using a quasi-experimental design. Leveraging World Values Survey data collected in Czechia and Uruguay during the invasion, we implement a regression discontinuity design that compares respondents interviewed immediately before and after February 24, 2022. This unexpected event during survey design approach addresses key limitations of correlational studies by exploiting quasi-random variation in exposure to the shock. Across multiple specifications -- including bandwidth sensitivity analyses, logit models, demographic controls, and robust bias-corrected estimates -- we find consistent null effects. The invasion produced no discernible immediate impact on either upward or downward mobility perceptions in either country, despite Czechia's geographic proximity and historical ties to the region. These findings complement prior correlational evidence showing associations between war concerns and mobility beliefs one year after the invasion, suggesting that such effects may unfold gradually rather than instantaneously, or that correlational patterns reflect selection into worry rather than immediate causal impacts. Our study demonstrates the value of combining multiple methods and measures when studying how geopolitical crises shape social perceptions.",

In public services such as policing, disproportionate attrition of women slows improvement of gender equality, but can also affect legitimacy and service outcomes. Typically, attrition of women in policing is studied in isolation, while sources (and thus, solutions) of inequalities may lie in societal or broader organizational dynamics. Using monthly employment register data, this study compared attrition of Dutch female policing staff to those of their male counterparts and their peers in other public subsectors. Findings indicated that, while women were more likely to leave the Dutch policing sector than men, several other subsectors showed similar gender differences. Results suggest that approaches to improve gender equality, both in policing and in other ‘gender-typed’ subsectors, should not be limited to increasing representation and should involve reviewing implicit assumptions about employees, including procedures for appraisal.",

        "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of evaluative capital, a form of personal academic capital grounded in quantifiable performance metrics (citation counts, h-index, journal impact factors) that function within both formal and informal academic evaluation rituals. Drawing on Randall Collins’s microinteractionism and Viviana Zelizer’s concept of circuits of value, and engaging with critiques of bibliometric indicators, the article distinguishes evaluative capital from Bourdieu’s symbolic capital by emphasizing its personal, quantifiable, and institutionalized nature. It develops a micro-stratification approach to theorize how such metrics are interpreted and converted into career resources through everyday academic interactions. The article examines how different actors (elite scholars, early-career academics, and late-career academics) accumulate and deploy evaluative capital, shaping patterns of academic stratification. Further, it explores the mechanisms by which metrics translate into professional advantages and the inflationary dynamics that can erode their value over time. Finally, the analysis situates evaluative capital within broader institutional and infrastructural conditions that shape visibility, commensurability, and symbolic valuation in science, shedding light on how metric-centric evaluation regimes transform academic hierarchies.",

        "abstract": "Background Co-production with public stakeholders is increasingly recognised as an important approach to ensuring health research is relevant to communities and interventions and likely to generate sustainable change. Ideally, co-production needs to be sustained throughout different stages of research and allow stakeholders ownership of the research agenda. We explore a case study of iterative co-production conducted over a nine-month period with a wide range of disparate stakeholders that transformed into a research-ready consortium able to design and obtain funding for a creative health research programme. Main body The ReCITE consortium is comprised of academics, creatives, and specialists in capacity development and community engagement in Liverpool, UK. Its main focus is health equity and coming up with new ways of working to tackle entrenched, avoidable and unfair differences in health. ReCITE led a series of six workshops in 2023 to co-produce a research programme to investigate creative approaches for improving health equity. Fifty-six stakeholders from the academic, creative and arts, health, community and voluntary sectors participated across six workshops that sought broad engagement and consolidated stakeholder input to develop a research agenda and expand the consortium. Common emerging themes were: 1) understanding complexities in funding creative health; 2) investigating storytelling as a catalyst for change; 3) achieving change through collective action; 4) the role of creative advocacy to change societal and funding structures; 5) evidencing the impact of community-led creative health interventions on health equity. These formed multiple co-produced outputs, including five pillars of a theory of change for the research that underpinned the research questions and determined five interventions to take forward by the research-ready consortium to securing funding for future work. Conclusion The iterative process of gaining stakeholder input, consolidating it, and seeking further input, helped to incorporate the perspectives of different stakeholder groups into different project outputs. Equitable power-sharing guided decision-making over what to prioritise was important in building ownership of the research agenda and trust among stakeholders. However, this was a lengthy iterative process and sustaining time commitment was difficult for those stakeholders who were not fully funded to participate.",

        "abstract": "In recent decades, hundreds of private art collectors have opened museum spaces, which they largely finance and control themselves. While such initiatives have been criticized as conspicuous consumption or vanity projects, one public benefit claimed is the display of new artistic perspectives: Due to their strong personal vision and independence, private museums have been argued (including by private museum founders themselves) to showcase underexposed artists and provide artistic innovation. We test this proposition with large-scale exhibition and auction data. We find that contrary to claims of artistic novelty, private museums disproportionately exhibit established artists, as their exhibition choices tend to favor artists who have already had longer careers, more prior exhibitions and higher auction turnover. Thus, the potential of private museums to serve as incubators of novel perspectives is limited.",

        "abstract": "The opening of sanctioned overdose prevention centers (OPCs) in New York City and the decriminalization of personal possession of all illicit drugs in Oregon marked significant changes to drug policy in the United States. Both changes came as the national yearly overdose deaths approached and then surpassed 100,000 deaths annually (CDC 2025a). Rising overdose deaths have been declared a state of emergency in the US and more Americans likely know someone who has died of an overdose than at any time in US history. In such an environment, new drug policies may have more support than they typically would. However, without sufficient public support, policy measures such as OPCs or decriminalization may be short-lived or reversed. In Oregon, the change in public support for decriminalization eroded enough from the passing of a law by ballot measure in 2020 to being revoked in 2024 by the legislature. Similarly, the current downturn in overdose deaths may cut support for sanctioned OPCs and other overdose prevention measures. Public support is therefore a critical component for sustained drug policy changes such as OPCs and decriminalization, even when these policies are introduced in times of emergency. In this paper, we studied the level of public support for OPCs and decriminalization measures as viewed by the general public in Nebraska. Nebraska is a state with little history of drug policy reform, a low rate of overdose deaths, and its residents are predominantly Republican. We estimated that 64.5% and 56.4% of adult Nebraskans support OPCs and 69.2% to 65.3% supported decriminalization in 2022 and 2023, respectively. This support was related to political party with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting both policies. However, 38% to 52% of Republicans also supported these two policies depending on the year. Although focused on Nebraska, these findings show what may be expected from similar states such as those in the Great Plains and Midwest areas of the US.",

        "abstract": "Marine heatwaves are accelerating under climate change and increasingly threaten the lives and livelihoods of coastal populations, particularly in low and middle-income countries where many households directly depend on local marine fisheries for protein, micronutrients and income. To quantify this threat, we link individual-level data on child and maternal health from 9,813 coastal sites in 36 low or middle-income countries to heatwave exposures in the nearby ocean, and use this linked dataset to estimate fixed-effects logistic regression models that test for heatwave effects on child mortality, child wasting, child stunting, and adult underweight. We find that a 1 SD increase in the number of heatwaves over a 24-month period increases the odds of child mortality by 5.4%, child wasting by 6.5% and child stunting by 8.8%, and that these effects also extend to other dimensions of heatwaves such as maximum sea surface temperature and cumulative intensity. Urban populations, unexpectedly, are most strongly affected, which may reflect their position as purchasers rather than producers of protein-rich foods. Taken together, these results document that marine heatwaves directly undermine human health and emphasize the continued importance of global monitoring for child and maternal health as well as oceanic conditions.",

This study used data from a national survey of adults to examine how, why, and to what extent parents’ expectations for athletic achievement are linked to underlying social inequalities. Logistic regressions using data from parents (n = 676-690) revealed factors associated with expectations of their children becoming a small college, college scholarship, or professional or Olympic athlete. Most parents appeared to have realistically pessimistic expectations. Higher expectations were apparent among parents of younger children, who perceived their children to have stronger athletic identities seemingly born out of their sport participation histories, who were sport fans, who had children that were Black or Latinx, who lived in neighborhoods with more non-White families, and, when it came to expectations of becoming a professional or Olympic athlete, who were from a lower socioeconomic status position. The child’s gender and the parent’s gender were not significantly related to athletic expectations and socioeconomic status was inconsistently related to expectations of becoming a college athlete. The results supported some theoretical arguments and contradicted others, and they can be used to target educational messaging around youth sport practices.",

We instead conceptualize Digital Connective Narratives (DCN) as a process of interactional co-construction that yields an emergent connective narrative field around shared issues and oppositional framings. Within this framework, Polarized DCN (PDCN) arise when these connective fields consolidate along five structural dimensions, social relevance, conflict scope, historical depth, power asymmetries, and emotional intensity. To illustrate the approach, we analyze debates on X (formerly Twitter) during South Africa’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign using topic modeling, stance classification, and adversarial-language detection tracked across rollout phases. Findings show that polarization did not diffuse across all topics: it concentrated in conflict-relevant debates, while institutional/informational topics remained largely non-polarized and faded over time. Within polarized debates, adversarial language intensified and engagement persisted, with challenger (non-institutional) streams gaining relative prominence as the campaign unfolded. As the pandemic’s immediate salience waned, public justification lost urgency and conflict retreated to a narrower circle of highly engaged users.",

        "abstract": "In-depth reporting serves a crucial public interest by delving beyond surface-level facts to provide context, analysis, and hidden truths on complex issues, thereby enabling a better- informed public. However, its evolution in China’s digital media remains insufficiently examined. Existing research on China’s media transformation has largely focused on state media, leaving a gap in comprehensive, longitudinal analyses of alternative digital genres. This article addresses this gap by constructing a longitudinal corpus of 42,472 articles from 16 leading in-depth reporting accounts on WeChat spanning 2013 to 2025. Using compu- tational methods, this study examines shifts in narrative style, moral framing, thematic focus, and the evolving conception of 'truth.' Findings reveal an emerging reporting style that increasingly prioritizes 'care,' focusing on personal experiences and individual truths over systemic or institutional analysis. Coverage of social systems, crime, and legal cases has declined markedly, while broader reform-focused narratives have largely disappeared over the past decade. These changes offer a granular, longitudinal picture of how China’s digital media landscape has evolved and reconfigured in a dynamic yet constrained manner.",

        "abstract": "Animals often stand as the most vivid symbols of the natural world, shaping how people imagine, value, and care for the environment. This study examines how emotional connections with animals relate to environmental attitudes and whether feelings of place attachment mediate this relationship. Drawing on frameworks from conservation psychology and sense-of-place research, two animal connection constructs—Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity—were tested as predictors of environmental concern among a U.S. sample of 282 adults. Each mediation model was estimated with 5,000 bootstrap samples, entering one predictor at a time while controlling for the other. These mediation models were specifically designed to evaluate whether place attachment functions as an intervening variable linking each animal connection construct to environmental attitudes, allowing us to estimate both direct and indirect effects while accounting for the other predictor. Results showed that both Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity were positively associated with pro-environmental attitudes and with both measures of Place Attachment. Place Attachment partially mediated the relationship between Animal Empathy and Environmental Attitudes. In contrast, Place Attachment did not significantly mediate the effect of Animal Solidarity, which was directly predictive of environmental concern. These findings suggest that empathy-based and solidarity-based connections with animals may foster environmental care through distinct psychological pathways. Understanding how affective bonds with animals shape place-based and environmental engagement can inform education, communication, and relational approaches to fostering ecological responsibility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper reframes debates about Indigenous sovereignty and constitutional legitimacy in post-colonial nations by examining the functional obsolescence of European ownership models in emerging post-scarcity conditions. Drawing on Ostrom’s (1990) Nobel Prize-winning principles of commons governance and the formal repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery (Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, 2023; UN Human Rights Council, 2021), we contend that Indigenous stewardship frameworks represent not historical artefacts but sophisticated legal systems optimally suited for abundance management. Quantitative evidence demonstrates that Indigenous-managed lands exhibit superior ecological outcomes compared to protected areas (Fa et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2019). Constitutional recognition of Indigenous sovereignty is presented as a positive-sum transition from the failing logic of the scarcity-based Extraction Paradigm (market/state binary) to the proven effectiveness of the Stewardship Paradigm. This analysis shows that legal continuity arguments cannot resolve foundational legitimacy deficits when the underlying dominant epistemic architecture actively obstructs human flourishing in conditions of technological potential and ecological urgency.

Evidence on how best to support their communication needs is limited. Objectives To develop an initial programme theory that synthesises knowledge on how communication interventions work in these settings, how they can be best designed, implemented, and evaluated, and the resources needed. Methods A realist review was conducted following RAMESES II standards, using seven databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library). After screening, included studies were assessed for quality and relevance, with data extracted from those rated moderate to high. Context–mechanism–outcome configurations were developed into an interim programme theory, which was discussed between March and November 2024 with n=53 adults with learning disabilities, carers, and professionals. The review was registered on PROSPERO [BLINDED FOR REVIEW]. Results Of 5,576 studies screened, 29 were assessed as moderate or highly relevant, contributing to ten context–mechanism–outcome configurations describing changes in: staff knowledge and awareness of communication; ability to assess individuals’ needs; and use of practices, techniques, tools, and support for choice-making. Organisational resources key to enabling staff skill development referred to changes in leadership, policies and procedures, environmental modifications, training and ongoing support. Outcome measures include those reflecting effective communication. Conclusions Good communication is a complex process that requires systemic support prioritising communication and meaningful relationships between staff and individuals. This initial program theory offers a framework to guide the implementation and evaluation of such support.",

        "abstract": "How can partisan favoritism persist when institutions have formal rules designed to prevent it? Existing scholarship emphasizes the electoral or elite payoffs of favoritism, but pays less attention to the processes that make partisan favoritism possible. We develop a theory of coordination advantage in which shared partisanship facilitates networks that link local and central officials. These networks provide privileged access to information and informal guidance, enabling local officials aligned with central officials to submit more and higher-quality grant applications without overtly violating formal rules. Using data on municipal grant requests and federal allocations in Brazil, we show that aligned mayors submit more proposals, receive more funding, and achieve greater compliance with technical standards than their unaligned counterparts. Original data on legislators' visits to municipalities and ministerial schedules show that partisan ties activate coordination. These findings suggest that partisan favoritism persists by exploiting partisan networks to navigate within institutional constraints.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding the intricate relationships between body, subjectivity, and emotions within social anthropology. Drawing on phenomenological, feminist, and critical social theory, I argue that these three dimensions constitute mutually constitutive domains that cannot be analyzed in isolation. The body is not merely a biological entity but a site of social inscription, cultural meaning-making, and lived experience. Subjectivity emerges through embodied practices situated within specific cultural contexts and power relations. Emotions, far from being purely individual psychological states, function as socially mediated phenomena that shape and are shaped by both corporeal experiences and subjective formations. By synthesizing contributions from phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, Csordas), practice theory (Bourdieu, Ortner), biopolitics (Foucault), feminist theory (Butler, Grosz, Fausto-Sterling), and the anthropology of emotions (Rosaldo, Ahmed, Lutz), this paper proposes an integrative analytical approach. This framework enables anthropologists to examine how social structures become embodied, how subjects navigate normative regimes through their corporeal existence, and how emotional experiences mediate between individual agency and collective formations. The paper concludes by discussing methodological implications for ethnographic research that takes seriously the embodied, emotional dimensions of subjectivity.",

        "abstract": "Mitigating climate change requires individual behavioral changes and robust support for green policies. However, significant carbon inequality — where wealthier individuals have disproportionately larger carbon footprints — potentially poses a challenge to building broad-based demands for meaningful climate change mitigation. High emissions by the wealthiest in society may dampen the general public's perception of responsibility and support for policies necessary for stringent climate change mitigation. For this reason, we investigate how information about unequal carbon emissions within countries affects public support for climate mitigation efforts through a survey experiment (N = 1,110) on a representative sample of US respondents, providing information about the distribution of carbon emissions. Results show that exposure to this information increases support for stringent climate policies, particularly those targeting wealthy individuals. Notably, respondents perceive wealthier individuals as more responsible for climate change, without diminishing their own sense of responsibility for reducing pro-environmental behaviors. These findings suggest that making carbon inequality more salient can enhance broad-based support for climate policies without compromising individual engagement, offering insights into strategies for facilitating the green transition.",

I compare their replies to questions on hypothetical movement behavior if hypothetically affected by natural disaster (pre-monsoon, May-June 2021) to migration intentions and actual migration 2-6 months later after quasi-experimental actual exposure (post-monsoon, August/September 2022/January 2023). Results show that hypothetical as well as actual affectedness and risk shape migration intent and behavior similarly. However, the vignette experiment is approximating actual migration intent more closely than migration, indicating that survey experimental approaches likely overestimate actual behavior, while capturing behavioral intent well. Given the evidence base for the external validity of survey experiments is slim, this study contributes a crucial comparison from a rarely studied developing-country context on the extent to which survey-experimental scenarios generalize to real-world exposure.",

By this I refer to a discourse governing human institutions and representations, not machines as dominated subjects. Adapting Judith Butler's account of foreclosure and Yu Matsuura's distinction between foreclosure and erasure from asexuality studies, alongside Bernard Stiegler's organological philosophy, I show how dominant AI narratives preempt the legibility of ongoing human and material labor. A brief genealogy traces how autopoiesis traveled from biology and cybernetics into AI rhetoric, where it underwrites the misrecognition of heteronomous systems as self-producing. Illustratively, I read reporting on content moderation and RLHF pipelines alongside Pasquinelli's history of ghost work to demonstrate how \"autonomy\" is performed atop distributed, often precarious labor. I advance the metaphor of the labored cognitive assemblage, outlining policy, design, and public-literacy implications (e.g., disclosure norms and labor standards) that follow when dependence is theorized as intrinsic rather than transitional. Reframing autonomy in these terms redirects debates about AI's social futures toward accountability, maintenance, and care.",

This study conceptualizes ‘data’ in journalism, a field profoundly shaped by data-intensive practices. Integrating perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS), infrastructure studies, and journalism practice, this study traces how data is embedded in news organizations. Following a Laswellian framework, we describe: What is datafied (subjects), who produces and processes data (actors), where data circulates (spaces), how data is composed (constructions), and why data is valued (values). To illustrate these facets, we construct a Patchwork News Outlet, which is a composite case that synthesizes empirical insights from six news organizations from five countries, identifying common data practices and points of divergence. Findings reveal that data practices span from the ubiquitous use of data, to selective engagement with data-driven strategies, and strategic resistance to datafication. We offer not one but five definitions of data, each grounded in a specific theoretical stream and derived from an analysis across the Lasswellian framework’s dimensions: data (1) as a socially constructed artifact shaped by power structures, biases, and strategic interests; (2) as an infrastructural entity embedded in socio-technical systems; (3) as resource for news stories; (4) as machine-readable input optimized for computational processing; and (5) as empirical representations of audience transactions and editorial practices, embedded with biases and contested value.

        "abstract": "As populations in both developed and developing countries continue to age, ensuring access to transportation that meets the mobility needs of older adults is becoming increasingly important. This issue is particularly pressing for individuals who are unable to drive or access private vehicles. Flexible Transport Services (FTS) offer a promising alternative to private transport for older people, thanks to features such as door-to-door accessibility and operational flexibility. This paper investigates travel satisfaction, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward FTS among older adults residing in the urban context of Birmingham, United Kingdom. A mixed-methods approach is employed, beginning with an analysis of travel frequency and purpose associated with FTS use, followed by a thematic analysis aimed at capturing older people's experiences, perceptions, and overall attitudes toward this mode of transport. The analysis reveals six key themes: lack of need, service provision issues, stigma, lack of awareness, convenience, and social implications. These themes highlight both the benefits of FTS and the factors that hinder its use. A central finding is the marked difference in perception between frequent users and non-users. FTS is often viewed negatively by non-users, with three of the four identified barriers predominantly arising from this group. In contrast, frequent users express satisfaction with the service, particularly emphasising its role in meeting discretionary travel needs. This is especially true for individuals over the age of 80 and those with limited access to a car.",

The present research examined the role of sociodemographic variables as predictors of CBRI among pre-service and in-service social work professionals in Germany, and how their endorsement of CBRI, in turn, relates to their sensitivity to recognizing racist incidents. Specifically, we introduce and tested a mediation model hypothesizing that older, more privileged professionals living in rural or Eastern German regions are less likely to recognize racist incidents due to their higher endorsement of CBRI. We additionally explored whether the assumed relationships differ between two forms of CBRI: colour-evasion and power-evasion. Results from a correlational, cross-sectional online study with pre- and in-service social workers (N = 242) largely supported our predictions. However, social workers’ region of residence (Eastern vs. Western Germany) did not emerge as a significant predictor of CBRI, and only power-evasion but not colour-evasion significantly mediated the relationships between sociodemographic variables and racism recognition. Implications of these findings for social work practice and education are discussed in light of critical race and critical whiteness theory.",

        "abstract": "This rapid evidence review investigates the barriers to urban greenspace access and how these disproportionately affect underserved communities. It introduces an original and theoretically enriched framework — the 6A Framework for Equitable Greenspace Access — which extends beyond spatial metrics such as proximity and coverage to establish a new analytical lens for addressing equity and justice in greenspace planning. Building on the 5 As of Access (Availability, Accessibility, Accommodation, Affordability, Acceptability) developed by Penchansky and Thomas in healthcare and extended with Awareness by Saurman, the framework integrates Fredman’s model of substantive equality. This synthesis generates a justice-oriented, relational approach that enables nuanced analysis of how intersecting forms of oppression shape exclusion across all six dimensions. The review of 89 studies shows that barriers to greenspace access manifest across multiple dimensions and disproportionately affect minoritised groups, including disabled children and women of colour. These findings highlight the need for intersectional, justice-led approaches to greenspace planning — approaches that redress social, spatial and historical disadvantage, recognise diverse needs and experiences, transform exclusionary systems, and enable meaningful participation. By advancing the 6A-4EGA, this review contributes an original conceptual and practical framework for identifying where exclusion occurs, how it manifests, and who it affects, thereby supporting more inclusive, equity-focused planning that advances environmental justice.",

        "abstract": "Since 2017, Western scholarly publishers have faced growing pressure from Chinese state regulators to restrict access to politically sensitive content or risk losing market access. This study examines the conditions compelling publishers to acquiesce to censorship demands through qualitative interviews with twenty-four participants: twelve Asia Studies academics and twelve publishing professionals. Thematic analysis revealed ten themes across six categories: conditions, definitions, responsibility, knowledge, resistance, and values. Censorship complicity stems from China's economic power and publishers' revenue dependence on subscriptions, article processing charges, and citation metrics. The study identifies pervasive tendencies to deny or redistribute responsibility, contributing to normalization despite value alignment opposing censorship. Self-censorship occurs in a climate of strategic uncertainty, where publishers withhold information to protect commercial interests and avoid anti-competition violations, preventing coordinated resistance. While author boycotts initially constrained compliance—reversing Cambridge University Press's 2017 decision to acquiesce to censorship demands—fragmentation has weakened collective action, particularly among early-career scholars dependent on access to China. Participants demonstrated shared conceptualizations of censorship and liberal-democratic values favouring resistance but diverged on whether China-based scholars' interests should inform responses. Collaborative resistance requires expanding stakeholder coalitions to include research funders and librarians through industry-wide frameworks analogous to the Global Network Initiative.",

        "abstract": "This article examines the role of Library and Information Science (LIS) in countering organized deception through ethical information stewardship. Drawing on Paulette Rothbauer’s framework of everyday information behavior and Benson George Cooke’s concept of epigenomic ignorance, it argues that truth distortion— manifested through misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation—is not merely a cognitive hazard but a structural enabler of trafficking, cartel violence, propaganda, and other organized harms. Using a taxonomy of information disorder and theological framing from Genesis and John 8:32, the piece positions LIS as a moral and public-health intervention. It outlines accountability practices— provenance tracing, contextualization, equitable access, and verification—as essential tools for disrupting epistemic violence and restoring communal agency. The article concludes that withholding information is not only a breach of professional ethics, as codified in the ALA’s Bill of Rights, but a betrayal of liberation itself. Truth-telling, in this context, becomes a ministry of repair.",

        "abstract": "With the adoption of the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, Artificial Intelligence Act, and European Media Freedom Act, the EU has set in motion an ambitious regulatory project to shape the governance of digital platforms and AI systems. This paper maps the governance stakeholders involved in the operationalization of these four instruments and examines their distribution of powers and responsibilities. Building on existing typologies of platform governance and regulatory space theory, we introduce an analytical framework that foregrounds three structural elements–competencies, capacities, and connectedness–alongside eight regulatory functions, ranging from agenda-setting to enforcement and discourse shaping. We then operationalize this framework in the context of the standardization ecosystem, highlighting the growing prominence of standardization bodies as central actors in multi-stakeholderism. Our analysis shows that, despite the promises of multi-stakeholderism for more democratic and cooperative governance configurations, in practice this approach often disregards material power asymmetries. This reality privileges technocratic expertise and industry stakeholders over public-interest actors, hindering ultimately a more equitable and democratic governance paradigm. We conclude by arguing that pursuing strategic autonomy, as the EU boasts, requires reducing the regulatory power of private actors and strengthening capacities of actors normatively and materially grounded in the public interest.",

        "abstract": "Die fortschreitende Digitalisierung bietet der Hochschulbildung neue Potenziale, insbesondere durch den Einsatz von Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI). Chatbots können selbstgesteuertes Lernen unterstützen, Lernprozesse individualisieren und zur Qualitätssteigerung in der Lehre beitragen (Hobert/Berens 2019). In diesem Beitrag wird ein Praxisbeispiel vorgestellt, in dem ein KI-gestützter Chatbot Studierende in einem bildungswissenschaftlichen Modul der Lehramtsausbildung begleitet, indem er Fragen beantwortet und Lernmaterialien bereitstellt, um das Selbststudium zu fördern. Neben praktischen Aspekten stehen die ethischen Implikationen im Fokus, wie der Schutz von Autonomie und Datenschutz sowie die Notwendigkeit von Transparenz im Lernprozess. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Förderung ethischer Kompetenzen im Umgang mit KI-Systemen, da Studierende nicht nur technologische, sondern auch kritische und medienpädagogische Fähigkeiten entwickeln müssen, um digitale Werkzeuge reflektiert und verantwortungsvoll zu nutzen (Knaus 2018; Kuka/Hörmann/Sabitzer 2024). Der Beitrag plädiert dafür, dass die Integration von KI nicht nur technologische Anpassungen erfordert, sondern auch eine umfassende medienpädagogische Auseinandersetzung, die Studierende und Lehrende mit Future Skills ausstattet. Abschließend wird die Rolle der KI als integraler Bestandteil der Hochschulbildung diskutiert, um Lernprozesse ganzheitlich und verantwortungsbewusst zu gestalten. The ongoing digital transformation provides new opportunities for higher education, particularly through AI-powered chatbots. These systems can support self-directed learning, personalize educational processes, and enhance teaching quality. This paper presents a practical example from teacher education in which a chatbot assists students by answering questions and providing learning materials. Alongside practical considerations, the ethical implications of chatbot usage—especially autonomy, data protection, and transparency—are discussed. A particular focus is placed on fostering ethical and media-pedagogical competencies, as students must develop critical skills to engage responsibly with AI systems. The paper argues that integrating AI in higher education requires not only technological adaptation but also a pedagogical approach that equips students and teachers with future-oriented skills.",

        "abstract": "As remote and hybrid work become more common, many workers are seeking ‘third places’ -alternative environments outside the home and office - to work and connect. This study explores the role of public libraries as alternative workplaces for remote workers in Australia. Drawing on survey data from 225 remote workers recruited via Prolific, we examine who uses libraries for remote work, how often, and why. Weekly, around eight per cent of respondents use libraries for at least half a day, a rate similar to that for coworking spaces, while a further one in three would consider doing so. Libraries are valued for quietness, affordability, internet access, and a sense of community, but limited privacy and restricted hours remain barriers. The findings highlight the library’s potential to meet workforce needs and offer practical implications for library managers seeking to design spaces and policies that better support remote workers and their wellbeing.",

Central elements of the concept include the reflection on one's own counseling practice, collegial supervision, and mentored feedback. The reflection on the concept highlights both supportive and challenging aspects of the learning processes, with particular emphasis on dealing with feedback, the application of counseling methods, and critical self-reflection.

        "abstract": "This chapter examines media imaginaries surrounding resource commodification in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, with a focus on events in 2020. It analyses two distinct yet interconnected media events. The first pertains to how the politics of natural resource commodification are debated and how various actors are positioned within these discussions. The second concerns the circulation of accounts of supernatural phenomena. The data include personal online exchanges from 2020–2021; three annual volumes (2018–2020) of a Central Kalimantan newspaper; selected news items from internet-based media (2017–2020); Twitter conversations from 2020 under various keywords; and selected YouTube videos featuring supernatural phenomena published between 2017 and 2020. First, the analysis argues that the Central Kalimantan mediascape is fragmented: established media outlets explicitly represent various state interests while claiming to serve the public, whereas social media discussions and circulating multimedia narratives often provide a counternarrative—if not constitute a counterpublic—serving as platforms for citizens to mobilise and articulate their interests. Second, the chapter introduces a new type of circulating discourse, termed “haunted publics,” in which accounts of supernatural events circulate in ways distinct from conventional counterpublics, yet the emergent effects of this circulation can still generate political critique. Third, consistent with previous research, it shows that discourses on supernatural events and resource politics are interrelated, even when they do not directly engage one another.",

We first explored and identified key patterns across 8,550 sensor-logged showering events from 319 German households. We then combined this high-resolution smart-meter data with time-stamped post-shower surveys to analyse shampoo-shower duration. The Gamma mixed model (14 predictors spanning demographics, context, in-shower behaviour and hair characteristics) explained 68.4% of deviance (AIC = 4281.6). Behavioural predictors showed the clearest associations: showers with two or more shampoo applications were 27% longer than those with one, while showers with three or more water pauses were 28% longer than those with one. Some contextual and demographic predictors also mattered: soft water areas were linked to 23% longer durations, and younger/mid-age adults had durations up to 31% longer than adults 50+. Other factors (gender, employment, household composition/size, home type, bills responsibility and most hair characteristics) showed small or uncertain effects after adjustment. Findings demonstrate how smart metering, event-level behavioural data and robust modelling can reveal actionable levers for demand-side management, behavioural interventions and product design.",

This study finds only limited signs of selective exposure: while intention to vote for or against the initiative was not related to the query stance, respondents’ climate beliefs partially influenced query selection. I further test whether selective exposure is greater when users choose queries from recommended options than when they formulate them independently, and discuss the role of expected vote outcome, political beliefs, and cognitive factors in query selection.",

Drawing on qualitative interviews with 15 university communicators from multiple countries, we develop a conceptual model that systematizes their perceptions of public backlash, the effects on them or their institutions, response strategies, and context factors. Our analysis introduces criteria for distinguishing legitimate criticism from illegitimate backlash and describes negative but also positive effects on science communication. The results elucidate proactive and reactive response strategies and highlight the influence of topic characteristics, routes of backlash, and sociopolitical contexts.

        "abstract": "Background: Canada’s 2021–2022 COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports were implemented with the stated aim of reducing transmission and hospital burden. In the absence of randomized controlled trial evidence for these endpoints, policymakers relied on vaccinated vs. unvaccinated comparisons from surveillance data and observational studies, as well as ungrounded simulations, despite known methodological limitations that rendered such evidence unreliable for public health policies with rights implications. Methods: We systematically critiqued Canadian public health surveillance reports and advisory briefs (Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health Ontario, Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table) together with related studies, identifying seven key biases classified by severity (critical/catastrophic), correctability, and scope. Distortions were quantified using published rate corrections, classification rules, time-series data, and population trends. Results: Critical biases included &gt;40% misclassification of early post-vaccination cases as unvaccinated and an 80-fold overestimation of senior unvaccinated hospitalization rates due to denominator errors. Additional critical biases—age-standardization obfuscating low-risk youth trends, testing fluctuations understating breakthrough cases, and misattribution rendering COVID-19 hospitalizations an invalid metric for burden—further distorted policy evidence. Catastrophic biases—selection and cumulative methodology—rendered group comparability invalid. Population trends showed case and hospitalization surges despite &gt;80% vaccination coverage, with vaccinated individuals dominating Omicron-era infections. Simulation studies retroactively justifying mandates contradicted real-world data with ungrounded counterfactuals used to estimate unproven benefits. Conclusions: Pervasive, uncorrected biases in observational comparisons invalidated causal claims of transmission or hospital burden reduction. Progressive reliance on weaker evidence—coupled with expert bodies' lack of transparency in emphasizing unproven benefits while dismissing dissenting views—highlights a systemic failure to meet evidentiary standards for public health policies with rights implications. This analysis underscores the need for greater scientific rigor in interpreting observational data through real-time bias correction, transparent limitation reporting, and risk-stratified approaches to uphold evidentiary standards, ethical proportionality, and accountability. These lessons hold global relevance for evidence-based public health policy.",

Onlineberatung bietet zeit- und ortsunabhängige Unterstützung und zeichnet sich durch Niedrigschwelligkeit und Zugänglichkeit aus. Ein zentraler Faktor für ihr Gelingen ist das Vertrauen zwischen Beratenden und Klient:innen. KI kann hierzu durch transparente Kommunikation, personalisierte Interaktionen und kontinuierliche Verfügbarkeit beitragen, wirft jedoch zugleich Fragen nach ethischer Nutzung und Datenschutz auf. Der Beitrag untersucht, wie Vertrauen in der Onlineberatung entsteht, welche Rolle KI dabei spielt und welche Barrieren der KI-Nutzung bestehen. Im Fokus stehen Chancen und Risiken des KI-Einsatzes aus Sicht von Fachkräften, die im Rahmen einer empirischen Erhebung beim DGSF-Online-Fachtag 2024 erhoben wurden. Advancing digitalisation opens new opportunities for online counselling, especially through the use of AI. Online counselling offers low-threshold, accessible support independent of time and place. A key success factor is the trust established between counsellors and clients. AI-supported tools can foster this trust through transparent communication, personalised interactions and continuous availability, while also raising challenges regarding ethical data use and privacy. This paper examines how trust is built in online counselling, the role AI plays in this process, and what barriers professionals identify regarding AI-supported counselling services. Special attention is given to opportunities and risks based on findings from an empirical study conducted at the DGSF Online Symposium 2024.",

Im nachfolgenden Artikel werden einige Gestaltungsparameter von Lernsettings, sowohl allgemein als auch auf digitale Arrangements bezogen, skizziert. Dabei kann festgehalten werden, dass es keine einheitliche Gestaltungslogik geben kann angesichts der Vielfältigkeit der mit einem Lernsetting verbundenen möglichen Ziele, Methoden und Zielgruppen sowie Inhalte.",

        "abstract": "Intimate partner abuse (IPA) conducted solely on a subtle level has not previously been studied, inhibiting therapist recognition and leading to potential further victim harm. This qualitative study explored the experience of subtle abuse amongst women of high educational and socioeconomic status (HESES) and therapists who had worked with similar women, to aid recognition. One over-arching theme of incongruence occurred in all a victim’s relationships, including with themselves and with therapists. Victims’ abuse-responding behaviours and abuse-related shame linked with their HESES. Identification of incongruence among victims and others, such as therapists, is central to the recognition of subtle abuse.",
