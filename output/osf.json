        "abstract": "The Youth Labor Law enacted in Peru in December 2014 aimed to address the high rates of youth unemployment and the large informal labour sector. The law introduced a set of labour rights and incentives for employers, including reduced vacation time, health insurance, and pension access for young workers aged 18-24, as well as tax breaks and decreased social healthcare coverage for employers. Despite its good intentions, the law sparked widespread criticism due to its unequal treatment of young workers, who would receive lower wages and fewer benefits compared to older employees doing the same job. While the government strongly supported the law, labour experts, civil society groups, and international organizations like the International Labor Organization raised concerns about its fairness and long-term implications. Public protests, mainly led by youth and labour unions, grew in opposition to the law, leading to its eventual repeal by Congress in January 2015. The law’s rapid passage and the lack of consultation with key stakeholders contributed to public distrust and resentment, underscoring the complex challenges of labour reform in Peru.",

        "abstract": "How do firms protect themselves against infringements of their property rights by their own government? The authors develop a theory based on international law and joint asset ownership with foreign firms. Investment agreements only protect the assets of foreign firms, not of domestic firms. This segmentation of the property rights environment creates a rationale for international financial relationships between firms. By forming financial relationships with foreign firms, domestic firms gain indirect coverage from the property rights available to foreign firms under investment agreements. If the government is less likely to violate the property rights of covered foreign firms, it is also less likely to violate property rights for assets held jointly by domestic and foreign firms. This article presents systematic evidence from data on the activities of firms in countries that have investment agreements with the United States. International financial relationships between firms, through mergers and acquisitions as well as through bond and equity issues, are more common where property rights are weak. The theory suggests a political logic to the fragmentation of firm-ownership stakes across jurisdictions, offers an institutional explanation of international financial flows, and identifies new distributional consequences of international law.",

        "abstract": "Can political parties steer public preferences for highly contested issues? European integration has become increasingly politicized, forcing governments to heed constituents’ preferences during international negotiations. Existing research suggests that parties can cue their voters, but it remains unclear whether public opinion responds to partisan cues on contentious, real-world European policies that directly affect national autonomy. To study the effects of in- and out-party cues on public preferences, we conduct a pre-registered information treatment experiment in five countries utilizing real-world treatments that avoid deception, while limiting the problem of pre-treatment. Applied to the case of joint European debt, we find that political parties can shape public opinion on fiscal integration, as both in- and out-party cues affect preferences. While our study focuses on EU politics, it has important implications for research on attitudes towards international cooperation more broadly.",

        "abstract": "This is a response to Kathryn Hendley and Peter Murrell’s criticism of “The emergence of the rule of law in Russia”, Global Crime, Vol.14, No.1, 2013. In that paper, I challenge the main claim in Kathryn Hendley, Peter Murrell, and Randi Ryterman’s “Law, Relationships, and Private Enforcement: Transactional Strategies of Russian Enterprises” in Europe-Asia Studies, Vol.52, No.4, 2000. Hendley, Murrell, and Ryterman claim that economic actors in Russia relied on the law and commercial courts because the latter were relatively effective. I argue that, in the late 1990s, economic actors trusted the commercial courts because they believed that they could influence the judicial outcome with bribes. In their reply, Hendley and Murrell (2014) conclude that Gustafsson (2013) cannot teach us anything about Russia or about their own work. In this paper: I defend my assessment of the commercial courts and discuss the influence of widespread corruption in the Russia of the 1990s. I also argue that their favourable view of Russian law and legal institutions is based on a sample that is marked by a serious error. This means that their conclusion about my work is an opinion rather than a verified fact.",

        "authors": "Timm Betz",
        "created": "2025-03-24",
        "abstract": "To explain trade policies, a large literature draws on domestic institutions. Institutions that are more responsive to narrow-interest groups are expected to succumb to protectionist demands, resulting in higher average tariffs. This literature has largely ignored the role of reciprocal trade agreements and of exporter interests. This joint omission results in a biased view of trade politics. Exporters benefit from expanding market access abroad. With reciprocity, they lobby for domestic tariff cuts in exchange for liberalization abroad, which alters the link between domestic institutions and trade policies. Institutions favoring narrow interests should privilege both protectionist groups and exporters and hence have an indeterminate effect on average tariff levels. Instead, more interest group influence should result in more dispersed tariff rates across products. This article provides empirical evidence for this proposition, helps reconcile existing findings in the literature, and offers a specific example of how international institutions affect domestic politics.",

        "abstract": "The ConTrust research initiative challenges the conventional wisdom that trust is antithetical to conflict. Instead, ConTrust posits that under certain social and institutional conditions, trust can also emerge in and through conflict. To lay the groundwork for this agenda, this working paper develops a basic concept of trust that is the foundation for more specific conceptions of trust. Furthermore, it distinguishes between justified and unjustified trust, introduces a notion of social integration through conflict, highlights the role of uncertainty and crisis in contemporary trust dynamics, and outlines avenues for studying trust formation in contexts of political, socio-economic, epistemic, and security conflict. Through this work, ConTrust seeks to advance our understanding of how modern pluralistic societies (and international orders) generate trust in the relative absence of shared norms and values, and to provide guidance on how conflict can be organized and shaped in ways that are productive of trust.",

        "created": "2025-04-14",
        "abstract": "This paper aims to explore an astrobiological genealogy of the concept of the Planetary vividly discussed in contemporary environmental humanities and social sciences, and to offer a framework for an articulation of political-economic models based on this concept. Following Bentley Allan, we propose to treat the Planetary as an example of scientific cosmology, thus emphasizing how astrobiology supports a much broader philo- sophical worldview that shines a new light on persistent problems related to organizing human inhabitation of the Earth. Starting with the analysis and speculative elaboration on Allan’s theory of cosmological shifts in international orders during Western modernity, we associate the Anthropocene discourse as an inaugurating moment in the consolida- tion of the Planetary’s scientific cosmology, grounded in the astrobiology’s metabolic per- spective on complex adaptive systems. The narrative of the paper offers a genealogy of this perspective, including the most recent research about information metabolisms and biosphere-technosphere coupling in astrobiology, which paves the way for the explanation of the economy itself as a metabolic entity. After the review of adjacent philosophical po- sitions associated with ecological economics and the theory of complex adaptive systems, the paper concludes with remarks on the Planetary as a cornerstone of an international order that yields economic imperatives governed by a generic view of the Earth as a mem- ber of a potentially large and diverse category of habitable planets.",

        "abstract": "Transit projects reshape the built environment and impact access to employment. Disentangling transit construction impacts from pre-existing trends presents methodological challenges. We address reverse causality by identifying counterfactual station locations from Environmental Impact Statements as control areas within a difference-in-differences framework. Analyzing extensions across 15 light rail lines reveals that transit investments catalyze neighborhood change. The older adult population 55+ within 15-minute walking distance from new stations declines. Workers in station catchments have shorter commute distances but trend toward lower-skilled sectors. The proportion of workers aged 30-45 and 55+ increases, while the share of individuals under 30 declines. We identify this increasing population as \"established essential workers.\" Housing prices show a marginally significant 9.8\\% increase when using construction start dates in defining treatment timing, but effects become insignificant when using opening dates. In general, light rail transit investment supports older workers in lower-skilled jobs while deterring older, retired adults and those in other trades.",

        "abstract": "This research analyzes Peru’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of the instrumental perspective, one of the main theories in Public Administration and that emphasizes rational decisions within goal-oriented and hierarchical structures. The paper examines the case study of the Peruvian government facing the COVID-19 pandemic and explores how the government implemented the vertical and horizontal specialization to manage this crisis. This is specifically important as the interplay between centralized executive authority and coordination across specialized unit faces unique challenges in the Latin American region. Through a qualitative analysis of institutional measures, policy implementation, and empirical data on health and socioeconomic outcomes, the paper identifies both the strengths and limitations of Peru’s pandemic governance. The findings highlight the challenges of applying instrumental theories to real-world crises in developing contexts, revealing the necessity for more context-sensitive governance structures.",

We describe the limitations of traditional metrics like Gini indexes in capturing the complex, inherently relational nature of inequality. By considering inequality as a series of subjective judgments made by individuals within their social cohorts, this study introduces a method where observations on inequality are aggregated both locally and globally, offering a nuanced view that accounts for both in-group and out-group disparities and proposing an inferential procedure to identify significant disparities at multiple levels. The approach is demonstrated through a case study on global wealth inequality, showcasing the dynamic and multifaceted nature of economic disparities across trading blocs.",

        "abstract": "Residential segregation based on socioeconomic status has long attracted the attention of researchers in the fields of human geography and sociology. This study examines whether disparities in exposure to natural environments, such as green spaces, also exist based on socioeconomic status. Using remote sensing, we analyzed Tokyo, Japan, and calculated the mean NDVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for each 250m grid. We then investigated its relationship with average household income. The results revealed that grids with higher average household income tend to have higher NDVI. Additionally, we explored whether NDVI could be predicted from socioeconomic and demographic variables. The findings indicate that NDVI can be partially predicted based on these variables. This suggests that exposure to natural environments is influenced by social science factors. Although natural environments appear to be open-access resources, our study demonstrates that disparities arise due to socioeconomic and demographic factors.",

        "abstract": "Since the early 2000s, the BRICS has emerged as a pivotal focus within the social sciences, framing discussions about shifts in global economic and political dynamics. This chapter examines how the concept of BRICS has evolved within social science discourse since the early 2000s, from its initial framing as an economic growth engine to a more complex phenomenon representing potential shifts in global governance and power dynamics. Through a systematic analysis of mainstream social science publications, the chapter maps the intellectual communities, geographic distributions, and funding sources that have shaped scholarly engagement with BRICS as a Global South phenomenon. Employing computational methods to analyze a specialized corpus, the research identifies key structural features of BRICS-related debates, disciplinary contributions, and underlying epistemic frameworks. By exploring how various social science disciplines—from economics and international relations to postcolonial studies and area studies—have approached BRICS, the chapter provides insights into how Global South subjects enter and circulate within mainstream knowledge production systems. This broad yet integrated analysis offers a comprehensive overview of how social sciences have documented, interpreted, and contributed to the evolving understanding of BRICS as a significant force in global affairs.",

        "abstract": "Web surveys are increasingly popular but tend to have more breakoffs compared to interviewer-administered surveys. Survey breakoffs occur when respondents quit the survey partway through. It reduces sample size for analysis, lowers statistical power and may lead to biased survey estimates. Few prior studies investigated how to compensate for breakoffs after survey data collection. This study develops a simulation where the breakoff rate and the cause of breakoffs are manipulated and then compensated for using five different methods. We find that using nonresponse weighting and multiple imputation compensate for breakoffs better than other methods investigated. Meanwhile, using breakoff weighting leads to the worst compensation results. Overall, we recommend multiple imputation for breakoff compensation as it has a good and consistent performance in the simulation and keeps the maximum amount of information in the data, therefore helping with the statistical power.",

This paper investigates how observing others’ apolitical characteristics – such as their gender, age, personality, or lifestyle choices – influences people’s decision to engage in political conversations, providing evidence supporting the “incidental model” of political conversations (Minozzi et al., 2020). We introduce the “dynamic parallel conjoint design” and field it in the Czech Republic, France, Italy, and Sweden. Our findings indicate that observing apolitical similarities with conjoint profiles consistently increases the likelihood of engaging in political conversation. While some studies suggest that observing apolitical similarities informs expectations about others’ political ideologies, which are then used to select conversation partners, our results show that political conversations are driven by the propensity to interact with people similar in apolitical respects, regardless of ideological expectations. Our study contributes to debates on political conversation dynamics and introduces an innovative methodological approach to studying implicit mediation in political behavior.",

        "authors": "George Y. Nie",
        "created": "2025-04-10",
        "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, volatility does not decrease asset value while volatility of a lognormal distribution actually raises value. We thus argue that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address these challenges, we propose that the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as the measuring distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former following a quasi-normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to all assets denominated by the currency. To be comparable across assets and firms, our asset risk is a 5-year payment’s risk that approaches zero as the distance approaches zero. We show that equity price reflects the present value of a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that an option’s price minus its present value reflects the overcharge or transaction cost. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, and redefines firm misvaluation theories.",

        "created": "2025-04-10",
        "abstract": "Literature on the political economy of large technology firms conceptualizes them as singular actors or agents in service of capital. We problematize this notion by drawing on literature on politics of corporate control, which identifies an inherent conflict between capital and management. We posit that technology firms’ shareholders should prefer technologies that entail fewer societal externalities than what the companies’ executives prefer. To observe such conflict, we analyse annual general meeting documents of top fifty tech firms, identifying shareholder proxy ballot initiatives aimed at shaping technological development toward less societal risk. Shareholders at Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft raised concerns over technologies such as AI and cloud computing, in some cases influencing the company’s behaviour. Such technology governance shareholder initiatives grew rapidly from 2015 onward to represent a fifth of all initiatives by 2024. We argue that this activism was part of a broader social movement that in the U.S. expressed itself via corporate governance institutions, because opportunities for legislative intervention were blocked. We contribute a model that conceptualizes technology firms not as actors but as sites of contestation between competing interests expressed via political, market, and corporate governance institutions. The model helps to explain why executives at technology firms with significant socio-political externalities invest not only into political lobbying but also disproportionately into corporate control. We also contribute to substantive technology governance literatures by highlighting corporate democracy as a neglected means for broader societal interests to influence technology.",

        "abstract": "Mexico is experiencing a crisis of violence, marked by an increase in disappearances. However, key information remains unknown, such as the primary gender and age of the victims, the high-risk zones for disappearances, and the relationship between these areas and the economic and security environment. We used a government database of 3,450 disappearances in Mexico City, together with scraped data to analyze the phenomenon of missing persons. We found that disappearances are not homogeneously distributed along Mexico City, the central district has the highest disappearance rate per capita, which can be attributed to city mobility for job locations. Men account for 62.5% of missing persons, but women aged 15-19 are the most vulnerable group. There is a strong correlation (r = 0.95) between reports of drug dealing and disappearances, both of which may be related to the presence of organized crime. Furthermore, when disappearances are normalized to account for mobility related to job locations, a strong negative correlation (r = −0.7) emerges between disappearances and housing prices. This suggests a pattern of socio-economic segregation in disappearances, with higher rates in areas with lower housing prices. Integrating data on disappearances, housing prices, reports of drug dealing, and perception of insecurity for each municipality, we implemented K-means algorithm. Without spatial information, K-means divided Mexico City in west and east. In the east side, people are more vulnerable to disappearances than those in the west side.",

        "abstract": "Suicide has long been constructed as an individual, pathological problem of the mind, requiring a combination of clinical care and interpersonal support to prevent it. The endurance of this individualising and pathologising approach serves to reflect and maintain the marginalisation of sociology in suicide studies. This article contributes to redressing this balance, via analysis of creative, qualitative workshops which formed part of a broader study exploring the politics of suicide. Informed by 33 participants’ contributions from six creative-response workshop groups, in dialogue with Lauren Berlant’s concept of ‘cruel optimism’, we propose a creative sociological (re)turn in suicide studies. Our analysis explores how the politics of UK suicide prevention constitutes a form of ‘cruel optimism’, obfuscating structural and sociological approaches to preventing suicide, and giving primacy to individual mental health-led interventions. We argue this provides a vital opportunity and urgent call for sociology to contribute more robustly to suicide research.",

As the full extent of the toxic relationship between the human species, world-altering technologies, and noxious substances and concepts comes into view, this new term helps to illuminate human power and powerlessness.

        "abstract": "Transportation researchers rarely publish findings based on qualitative methods in peer-reviewed transportation journals; quantitative methods dominate research in the field. In this article, we document and examine the effects of this quantitative orientation in transportation research. We relied on in-depth interviews with 46 researchers and editors and systematically reviewed the methods used in published top transportation journals. Qualitative research accounts for a very small but growing share of peer-reviewed publications in transportation journals. Interviewees reported widespread misunderstandings of qualitative research methods and a lack of expertise from reviewers and editors in evaluating this type of work. The barriers that qualitative researchers face in peer review have implications for individual careers and the field of transportation more broadly. Gatekeeping around research methods limits how our field understands critical transportation issues with potential implications for practice and policy.",

        "authors": "YUMING ZHANG, Linrui Zhong",
        "created": "2025-04-12",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a methodological approach to employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for academic literature classification, using complexity theory literature as its empirical domain. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source LLMs—Qwen-QwQ-32B and Llama-4-maverick—on their capacity to accurately categorise scholarly papers according to predefined theoretical frameworks. Our methodology employs two distinct enhancement techniques: an iterative processing approach designed to improve reliability by generating multiple independent classifications for each document, and a calibrated weighting technique aimed at enhancing validity by adjusting probability distributions toward reference distributions. To assess validity, we employ proximity accuracy measurements that quantify the degree of alignment between LLM-generated classifications and human coding. The experiment included 25 iterations (3,100 records in total coded by LLMs). Our findings demonstrate that both LLMs achieve strong base performance (&gt;70\\% validity) that could be further improved through calibration (reaching up to 90.32\\% validity), with diminishing returns after approximately 15 iterations. The impact of weighting varies significantly by category and model, suggesting that selective application of weighting approaches may be optimal. We conclude with recommendations for researchers employing LLMs in qualitative coding workflows, particularly for applications in Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and similar methodologies requiring rigorous category assignment. This research contributes to developing transparent, replicable procedures for LLM-assisted qualitative coding that maintain methodological integrity whilst leveraging computational efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The recurrency of extreme climate phenomena worldwide has made increasingly evident the correlation between human activities and climate change. COVID-19 pandemic is just one of the last “wake-up” alert for urgently rethink behaviours that have been forced to change during lockdown providing further evidences of human impacts on the environment (i.e. pollution reduction, re-naturalization, re-wilding, etc.). Enabling people's capacity to observe phenomena and reflecting upon the impacts of individual and collective behaviours on natural resources, requires efforts to make scientific knowledge accessible to all. The adoption of user-friendly tools - i.e. working on the public understanding of science and data - could contribute to overcoming the intention-action gap that limits people's capacity to positively impact on the local contexts in everyday life. The Municipality of Bologna is paving the way for a climate responsive society: the Impronta Verde project is a territorial strategy designed to contextualise future projects on urban open space (green spaces, public spaces, soft mobility infrastructures, etc.) within a systemic vision that, with the primary objective of implementing sustainability in the metropolitan urban environment, aims to reconstruct a continuity of the territory's blue and green networks, while improving the liveability, accessibility and beauty of the city. The Horizon 2020 project RESET aims at enhancing the adoption of environmental intelligence - i.e. coupling monitoring and modelling - to co-design green investments for enhancing urban adaptation to climate change. Within this framework, the Bologna case study adopts an open process based on collaborative data collection and data visualisation, allowing citizens to play an active role in monitoring, understanding and processing information with regard to urban heat phenomenon, and the effectiveness of urban green areas in reducing their impacts on the community wellbeing. Citizen science local initiatives will be activated by a peer-to-peer process, in which citizens will be involved in collaborative data collection and will improve their data literacy through a communication process based on data visualisation.",

        "abstract": "Social media companies continuously experiment with various platform governance models to tackle content moderation challenges, which calls for a comprehensive and empirical understanding of how a content moderation system evolves over the long term. Our study aims to fill this gap through a quantitative and qualitative study of Weibo's community-driven content moderation system, leveraging eleven million public moderation cases and decision data from 2012 to 2021. Based on reporting activities, platform decisions, and jury actions, we investigated the motivations and behavior patterns of three important actors in this governance model: reporting users, the platform, and user jurors. We suggest that users who frequently reported content and initiated the community-driven content moderation process tend to exhibit patterns of voluntarily policing the community or abusing others, sometimes coordinately, and were also treated differently by the platform. We indicate that Weibo's strategic moderation decisions have significantly distinctive preferences over cases from various topic categories and different levels of harmfulness, and the cases involving socially sensitive issues were given more consideration and penalized more severely than common misbehaviors. We also explore how the platform leveraged the usually one-sided votes of digital jurors to endorse its final decisions and find that the reason notes given by crowdsourced jurors also revealed a serious issue of decaying motivation. Our findings offer important insights into the coordination between a social media platform and its volunteer moderators to moderate an online community and address the question of how an autonomic platform governance model can prevail or perish.",

We found a direct association between supervisory procedural justice and organizational citizenship, and an indirect association between organizational procedural justice and organizational citizenship, through mental wellbeing. These findings suggest that while prison officers directly reciprocate the fair treatment received by supervisors by engaging in discretionary actions benefiting the organization, fair treatment by the organization has more of an indirect effect via influencing officer wellbeing. Our results highlight the importance of both supervisors and organizations treating their staff with procedural justice; not only is fair treatment associated with greater mental wellbeing, but it encourages behaviors that extend beyond formal job requirements. Cultivating such behaviors among new prison officers may ultimately improve practices, cultures, and outcomes for people in custody within prisons.",

        "abstract": "In the context of a corporate retreat from diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), this article argues that such withdrawals are not ideological reversals but the culmination of branded strategies governing moral visibility. Employing sociosemiotic analysis, it develops a typology of visionary, sensitive, and reflexive branding approaches, examining how empathy is selectively framed to align with commercial objectives. Introducing the concept of ontological erasure, the study demonstrates how branded moral economies systematically render certain subjects and struggles invisible or politically inert. Across media platforms, empathy shifts from ethical relationality into a marketable asset, strategically curated according to affective resonance. Such selective visibility shapes public understandings of social justice, determining whose suffering gains recognition and which causes become morally actionable. By theorizing affective recognition, the article critically reveals how brands manage emotional engagement to sustain market legitimacy, highlighting the strategic logic behind corporate disengagement from DEI and the consolidation of moral hierarchies.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the ethical dimensions of health communication during the 2022 mpox outbreak, focusing on the interplay between social media and public health officials in shaping stakeholder responses. Based on semi-structured interviews, findings reveal that social media played a crucial role in information dissemination for months during the crisis, while public health officials were slow to offer clear guidance. While social media empowers advocacy and the sharing of personal stories, it also raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding how vulnerable communities may become entangled in an economy of suffering, where their experiences of pain are validated and interpreted by stakeholders through a selective mechanism rooted in cultural codes and power dynamics. Moreover, systemic inequities render the suffering of marginalized groups, particularly those with intersecting identities, less visible and intensify the consequences of inadequate outreach. This creates a disparity where the suffering of those in more privileged positions is more readily recognized and addressed. The theoretical advancement lies in reconceptualizing the platformization of pain to include narrative resistance, highlighting that marginalized groups actively contest and reshape suffering narratives rather than passively experience them. This expanded framework also deepens the concept of an economy of suffering by integrating hermeneutical injustice, which emphasizes how power dynamics shape not only the visibility of suffering but also the interpretive frameworks that validate certain narratives while marginalizing others.",
