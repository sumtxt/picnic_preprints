        "abstract": "This review investigates Singapore’s emergence as a carbon credit trading hub and its evolving role in shaping Southeast Asia’s climate finance architecture. Drawing on a narrative-integrative methodology, the paper synthesizes grey literature, government policy, institutional reports, and verified academic sources to critically assess how Singapore constructs and governs its carbon market platform. The analysis is structured around three interrelated questions: (1) how Singapore builds its institutional and financial infrastructure to mediate carbon flows; (2) how public and private actors coordinate to establish authority and credibility within a hybrid governance model; and (3) how the platform-based architecture produces both opportunities and asymmetries across the ASEAN region. Conceptually, the paper engages with theories of platform capitalism, soft market regulation, and green financial intermediation to interpret Singapore’s infrastructural strategy. The findings suggest that Singapore’s market-oriented approach—anchored by mechanisms such as Climate Impact X, Article 6 bilateral agreements, and green financial instruments—functions not only as a facilitator of decarbonization but also as a gatekeeper of regional participation. While this model enables cross-border interoperability and enhances access to global climate finance, it also introduces risks of institutional dependency and normative concentration. The paper concludes by identifying gaps in current scholarship and proposing a future research agenda focused on comparative carbon governance, platform power, and the political economy of Article 6 implementation in Asia.",

        "abstract": "How do ministerial terminations affect presidential approval? Presidents face unexpected challenges related to stochastic events such as scandals, policy failures or economic crises. We argue that the termination of ministers who have received calls for their resignation presents an opportunity for the president to send signals to the electorate in the expectation of a corrective effect on popularity through a blame-shifting dynamic. The central argument is that this dynamic only occurs in coalition governments where political responsibility may be more easily attributed to the coalition’s different parties and factions, weakening personalisation centred on the president and facilitating blame-shifting and the corrective effect. The expectation of a corrective effect on approval is tested using instrumental variables (IV) regressions applied to novel data on ministerial terminations and resignation calls in 124 governments in 12 presidential democracies. The data were gathered by combining data mining, machine learning techniques and survey marginal time series based on the dyad ratios algorithm for approval. The main findings support the expectation that individual terminations of tainted ministers generate a corrective effect of nine points on presidential approval in coalition governments, which decreases in the medium and long term.",

        "abstract": "Needs for security and certainty (NSC) vary in their relationship with economic preferences as a function of political engagement. Among those low in engagement, NSC is directly related to left-leaning economic preferences, since social welfare can be regarded as insurance. Among those high in engagement, NSC predicts right-wing economic preferences, since engaged individuals high in NSC take cues from right-leaning elites suggesting that support for redistribution is inconsistent with conservative political identities. Examining comparative European public opinion, we argue that this ‘reversal’ is less applicable to universal basic income (UBI), since the latter is an unconditional benefit that detaches welfare provision from specific situations of risk (e.g., unemployment insurance). This should shift individuals to think of provision in terms of moral hazard (e.g., work avoidance) in the context of UBI. Using Round 8 of the European Social Survey, we test and find support for several hypotheses based on this argument.",

        "abstract": "In parliamentary democracies, voters delegate the power of replacing the chief executive to the more knowledgeable legislators. The logic of costly signaling suggests that this indirect accountability helps voters ensure a competent prime minister (PM). I formally model this indirect executive accountability and show that while the incentive of the legislators in the PM's party to signal their leader's competence leads to increased voter welfare through two distinct mechanisms, the PM's incentive to remain in office can eliminate this welfare effect. Specifically, if we consider that the PM can use their delegated authority and resources to maintain the support of the legislators in the PM's party, the benefit of indirect executive accountability is in general diminished and may be even eliminated. I also examine how the clarity of the PM's responsibility affects voter welfare and highlight that greater clarity is not always good for voters.",

        "authors": "Ognen Vangelov",
        "created": "2025-04-23",
        "abstract": "This article examines the long-term effects of Macedonia’s post-conflict power-sharing arrangement, introduced by the Ohrid Framework Agreement (2001), on interethnic integration and democratic accountability. While the consociational model is widely credited with stabilizing the state and ensuring minority inclusion, it has also contributed to the institutional entrenchment of ethnic segmentation, shaping the incentives of political competition and governance. The article introduces the concept of ethnopolitical cartelization to describe how consociational power-sharing facilitates the consolidation of dominant ethnic parties as gatekeepers to state institutions, limiting intra-ethnic pluralism while preserving interethnic parity. Drawing on institutional analysis and empirical evidence, the article argues that key features of the Macedonian model, such as ethnic veto mechanisms, proportionality rules, and decentralized governance, have incentivized the monopolization of political representation within ethnic blocs, most clearly exemplified in the long-standing dominance of DUI within the Albanian political segment. This dynamic has enabled the development of vertically integrated party structures that channel access to state resources through identity-based patronage and informal governance. The result is a form of segmented stability in which public administration, education, and language policy operate through parallel structures. The Macedonian case illustrates the broader limitations of consociational design in deeply divided societies: while formal inclusion is achieved, it may come at the expense of shared civic space, horizontal accountability, and democratic responsiveness. By segmenting political authority and embedding elite brokerage into the structure of governance, the system inadvertently entrenches the very boundaries it was designed to overcome.",

        "created": "2025-04-17",
        "abstract": "Embedded in a broader discourse on future-oriented social policy and the idea of a social investment welfare state, governments in many of the advanced economies expanded childcare in recent years. Yet, in many countries considerable regional variation exists in coverage rates and expansion efforts, and often the supply of childcare still does not match demand. In this paper, we explore the politics of this regional variation by studying Germany, a country which had relatively low rates of childcare coverage for a long time, but recently introduced a legal entitlement to childcare. Despite this legal entitlement, we argue that local political and economic factors (continue to) matter for childcare expansion. We expect left-wing local political majorities to be associated with stronger expansion dynamics. At the same time, tight local fiscal constraints, which are widespread in Germany’s fiscal federalism, should limit partisan room for maneuver and party effects, and should slow down expansion. Analyzing local-level data on childcare coverage rates, socio-economic context factors and government partisanship, we find empirical support for our expectations. Building on these findings, we furthermore examine how local governments reconcile gaps in childcare provision with the legal entitlement to childcare and what distributive consequences this has.",

        "authors": "Adam Calo, Sylvia Kay, Eliaz Moreau",
        "created": "2025-04-23",
        "abstract": "Rethinking the regulation of land markets is central to the agroecological transition in Europe. The EU has bold, evidenced-based policy objectives for food system and environmental transformation. Yet, absent a parallel process for regulating land, these policy objectives will remain watered down or impossible to obtain. The EU has shown commitments to invest in environmental policy experimentation because it knows the future wellbeing of the continent depends on sound land use management. However, there is no parallel movement towards reimagining European land governance. This status quo imperils the EU green agenda and threatens the legitimacy of desperately needed environmental policy. Identifying enticing policy options to inspire new land governance can help fulfil existing EU sustainability commitments and open meaningful pathways to scale agroecology. This research first uses existing evidence from the literature to show how current European land markets—governed by the main freedoms of the EU treaties—weakens the capacity to achieve generational renewal, the vitality of rural areas, and land based biodiversity maintenance. Then we reveal existing and potential opportunities for European land market regulation. Through this analysis we argue that agricultural land is a blind spot in European policies for the transition to agroecology, and thus reframe land regulation as an enabling tool to install young and new farmers, facilitate biodiverse landscapes, and build durable rural economies. Measures like transparency in land markets, public acquisition of agricultural land, establishing a first right of refusal, and taxation to facilitate access to land may unlock land for a new generation of agroecological farmers. Exploration of these policy cases calls for an imaginative expansion of public action on land markets to tackle food system challenges, and is aimed directly at policy makers.",

The Indian state with its development actions and governance functions, are proliferating across the Indo-Bangladesh borderlands in India. Owing to the phenomenon, this article intends to intertwine the actor-oriented ‘anthropology of borderlands’ with the politico-legal framework of ‘governance and development’; to locate the impact of ‘development and local governance initiatives’ of the state agencies and its functionaries on the people residing at the praxis. It also highlights the need for focusing on different political economic contexts for development and observe how people on the subject of development – are responding or reacting, sidestepping or resisting against a structural factor like the borderland that has acted on them; whereas, the state policies and its narrative of ‘Development’ have turned contradictory to the aspiration of the population at the praxis that is synergetic in terms of localized differences in demography and socio-political history.",

        "abstract": "Governments across the world have increasingly used laws to restrict the work of nonprofits, which has led to a reduction in public or official foreign aid directed towards these groups. Many international nonprofits, in response, have turned to individual donors to offset the loss of traditional funding. What are individual donors' preferences regarding donating to legally besieged nonprofits abroad? We conducted a conjoint experiment on a nationally representative sample of likely donors in the US and found that learning about host government criticism and legal restrictions on nonprofits decreases individuals' preferences to donate to them. However, organizational features such as financial transparency and accountability can protect against this dampening effect. Our results have important implications both for understanding private international philanthropy and how nonprofits can better frame their fundraising appeals at a time when they are facing restrictive civic spaces and hostile governments abroad.",

        "abstract": "This article investigates the scientization process in central banks, using the Bank of England (BoE) as a case study. Its main goal is to clarify the interactions and tensions among three dimensions of scientization: contributory, policymaking and legitimizing. To do so, we outline an ideal type of contributory scientization in central banks, whereby they become active contributors to science. The article derives empirically observable characteristics for this ideal type, regarding leadership and staff profiles, use of internal resources, composition of external networks, and publication and discursive outputs. The BoE is then contrasted to this ideal type of a central bank thoroughly involved in contributory scientization. The empirical material includes archives and interviews as well as three databases providing quantitative information from the 1970s to 2019. We find that the development of contributory scientization is strategically motivated, often generating tensions with policymaking and legitimizing dimensions. Our findings suggest that scientization in central banks is best understood as a three-dimensional, non-linear process, rather than a steamroller.",

        "authors": "Maybritt Jill Alpes",
        "created": "2025-04-18",
        "abstract": "The article examines how academics can mobilize their epistemic resources to engage with justice claims able to challenge border violence. Many migration scholars would like to find ways to mobilize their knowledge to resist migrants’ human rights violations. Despite increased focus on research impact, border violence is only increasing. On the one hand, policy makers do not act on scholarly recommendations that are highly critical, but not necessarily actionable. On the other hand, when scholarly recommendations are actionable, legal and policy changes do not necessarily result in meaningful improvements for refugees’ and other migrants’ dignity. As a result, there is a dichotomy between applied research that is not critical and critical research that is not actionable. Against this backdrop, this article explores how migration researchers can reclaim the meaning of impact and smuggle critique into the term. The article is based on auto-biographical explorations of what it means for an anthropologist to produce knowledge on migration from within law faculties and as policy officer and research consultant for human and refugee rights organizations. Based on this material, the article argues that migration scholars who seek justice should not produce more evidence, but rather take law seriously as a knowledge practice. The article develops three design principles for migration scholars who seek to resist in the short- and medium-term migration laws and policies that violate human right principles. First, build knowledge alliances with justice actors. Second, theorize knowledge needs in justice claims. Third, broker the validity of truth claims.",

Women also bear the greater cost of oil-induced environmental harms which adversely affect their traditional livelihood of farming and fishing. Scholarship on human trafficking in Nigeria focused scant attention on the structural conditions that influenced women experience of human trafficking in extractive contexts. This article examines how oil politics perpetuate gender violence and expose women to human trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labour in the Niger Delta region. Based on feminist political ecology perspectives and field studies in selected oil communities, the study seeks to explain how oil politics perpetuate women’s socio-economic deprivation, in ways that expose them to human trafficking as victims and accomplice. Women exposure to human trafficking amplify their experience of gender violence and violate their rights and aspiration for emancipation and justice in Nigeria’s oil extractive region. International organizations and policy makers need to consider the global and local dynamics that magnified women’s experience of human trafficking in extractive communities and the wider implications for the global and local efforts to combat human trafficking.",

We conduct a meta-analysis of 52 correspondence audits, encompassing nearly 330,000 tests for discrimination, and a re-examination of each study using seven discrimination ratios. The meta-analysis reveals a previously overlooked pattern in rental housing discrimination: compared to White men, Black men experience discrimination, Black women's outcomes are statistically similar, and White women receive preferential treatment. Additionally, our re-examination uncovers ten ways scholars may unintentionally miss key findings when failing to adopt a systematically comparative intersectional approach. We conclude with best-practice recommendations to guide scholars in designing, analyzing, and citing correspondence audits, helping them avoid these problematic scenarios. Importantly, our framework extends beyond field experiments focused on race and gender and can be broadly applied to research on disparities, enabling more comprehensive analyses across numerous dimensions.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a critical ambiguity in the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), a cornerstone of libertarian philosophy that prohibits initiating force against others. While effectively guiding two-party interactions, the NAP lacks clarity regarding third-party bystander intervention. Utilizing formal logic and set theory, this study identifies a logical 'NULL state' inherent in traditional NAP formulations, which leaves bystander actions undefined. To resolve this, the paper introduces a modified NAP (MNAP), explicitly permitting voluntary, consent-based bystander intervention. The proposed refinement enhances the practical applicability of the NAP in complex multi-agent scenarios, offering libertarian societies a coherent framework for ethically and legally addressing immediate situations of aggression through consensual collective action.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we test the applicability of the EU issue voting model to the case of the 2024 Czech European Parliament elections. Given the increasing importance of the issue of leaving or remaining in the European Union, we examine whether voters’ attitudes towards this issue affect their electoral behaviour. Furthermore, research on individual-level salience's effects on EU issue voting is limited. To address this gap, we leverage post-election survey data on the importance voters attribute to the issue of leaving the EU to assess whether salience influences turnout and moderates the effect of voter preferences on party choice. We show that voters who judge the issue of Czexit to be highly salient are less likely to abstain. Additionally, we find that in general, voters’ attitudes regarding Czexit exert only a weak effect on their decision to support parties that reflect their views on this issue. However, we find that this effect is moderated to a large degree by the salience that voters attribute to the issue, in that voters considering the question of Czexit to be highly salient are considerably more likely to support parties that match their preferences (i.e. Czexit supporters vote for hard Eurosceptic parties and remain supporters for non-hard Eurosceptic parties). Thus, the study concludes that voter behaviour largely follows an EU issue voting logic, highlighting the key role played by issue salience in this process.",

We employ two factors to model the expected risk-free rate that the market expects the current monetary policy to move towards the neutral rate over a certain period. Expecting that the T-bill risk (i.e., the macrorisk) largely reflects a country’s inflation risk, we measure the risk as a 5-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. We use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors to solve the model factors. Our models thus split US and Canada T-bill yields into the risk and risk-free rate, on average explaining 98.8% of the returns. The models assuming the return independence even show stronger power in predicting T-bill returns. We also find that a negative risk of several basis points, which is constant over maturity, probably reflects the transaction cost or the risk of inter-back short-term lending. The risk and the risk-free rate represent the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets in the country.",

        "abstract": "A general supply chain is a division of labor of an arbitrary number of subtasks, which has asymmetric interactions among the subtask-holder groups. To sustain a supply chain, cooperation among the subtask-holders is a must. We construct a general network model of supply chain with a finite number of roles with a single output, where the supply of faulty products is possible and a supply chain never stops on the way. We consider that cooperators and defectors exist in each subtask-holder group in a supply chain; cooperators of a subtask-holder group pay a cost of cooperation to maintain and upgrade the quality of the product, defectors however do not pay any cost, and thus the product quality reduces. In some supply chains, more cooperators upgrade the quality of the product more, and players can obtain a better reputation defined as a bonus that is given to all players. We found that the supply chain with a bonus confronts the social dilemma. We make replicator equations of asymmetric games to investigate the evolution of cooperation in a supply chain. We found that not the benefit from supply but the cost of cooperation influences the dynamics. As a result, the network structure of the supply chain never influences the dynamics. Sanction on the defectors induces the evolution of cooperation and non-linear bonus functions promote co-existences of cooperator groups and defector groups. The bonus functions determine whether the length of the supply chain promotes the evolution of cooperation or not.",

Mechanisms that generate gains from integration, such as external economies of scale and specialization, also increase the hegemon’s power because in equilibrium they make other relationships poor substitutes for those with a global hegemon. Other countries can implement economic security policies to shape their economies in order to insulate themselves from undue foreign pressure. Countries considering these policies face a tradeoff between gains from trade and economic security. While an individual country can make itself better off, uncoordinated attempts by multiple countries to limit their dependency on the hegemon via economic security policies lead to inefficient fragmentation of the global financial and trade system. We study financial services as a leading application both as tools of coercion and an industry with strong strategic complementarities. We estimate that U.S. geoeconomic power relies on financial services, while Chinese power relies on manufacturing. Since power is nonlinear and increases disproportionally as the hegemon approaches controlling the entire supply of a sectoral input, we estimate that much economic security could be achieved with little overall fragmentation by diversifying the input sources of key sectors currently controlled by the hegemons.",

        "abstract": "Health, according to the World Health Organization, is a state in which people have achieved their physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being and are not restricted to any particular disease or its treatment. In keeping with that idea, mental health refers to a person's physical autonomy, sense of competence in reaching their intellectual and emotional potential, ability to manage the stresses of everyday life, and ability to contribute to their community. According to recent studies, India has the largest tribal populations in the world, and a sizable portion of these people suffer from a variety of mental health conditions. The state of mental health conditions among India's tribal groups and their collective capacity, based on their knowledge and beliefs, to address the new issues that are causing an increase in mental health problems among themselves are discussed in the following article. Previous studies have also indicated that each tribal society's unique and distinctive culture has influenced how they interpret mental health concerns, which has helped them develop different approaches to managing or treating them. According to earlier studies, the authorities frequently force their policies and choices on tribal groups without consulting them. This has resulted in a number of obstacles that prevent the tribal groups from effectively managing particular mental health-related illnesses. Therefore, the essay that follows makes the case that a belief-based, culturally unique approach to the effective and long-term screening and treatment of mental health-related problems and disorders among the vulnerable can be seen as a feasible substitute in the future.",

Drawing on identity theory, crisis vulnerability, and social stratification literature we examine educational disparities in changes of political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic and its subsequent years in Germany. We combine individual-level panel data (NEPS, 2017-2023, 24,087 person-years) on trust in institutions and media surveyed before, during, and after the pandemic to explore the role of individual- and household-level crises-affectedness as well as county-level infection rates and restriction measures. Results from linear regression models with individual fixed-effects reveal a sharp and statistically significant initial trust increase, particularly among lower-educated individuals and for institutional trust. As the pandemic progresses, trust declines below pre-crisis levels, with somewhat more pronounced changes among lower-educated individuals. Infection rates, restriction measures or changes in individual objective and subjective pandemic affectedness do not substantively explain educational disparities but mediate both increases and decreases in trust among both groups. From a broader perspective, the results point towards the importance of selective containment measures as well as subjective negative economic and social consequences that are likely to shape attitudinal change in times of crises.",

        "abstract": "As young adults, the Millennial generation arrived as the largest and most racially and ethnically diverse generation in U.S. history. These unique demographic characteristics, along with more progressive self-reported views on racial and ethnic issues, have prompted some to label this generation as a demographic bridge to America’s diverse future. This article examines whether these unique characteristics translate into greater neighborhood racial diversity and integration. Specifically, this study sets out to answer whether Millennial young adult neighborhoods are more racially and ethnically diverse and located in less segregated metropolitan areas than the young adult neighborhoods of prior generations. Using 1990-2019 Census and American Community Survey data, we find a mixed story. On the one hand, young adult White Early Millennials were living in neighborhoods with similar or slightly higher diversity levels, and metropolitan areas with similar or slightly lower segregation levels compared to White young adults in prior generations. On the other hand, young adult White Late Millennials tend to live in more segregated neighborhoods, and in most cases, their segregation levels surpass those for White young adult Gen Xers. These mixed findings provide moderate support for the perspective that the Millennial generation is a bridge to diversity, albeit not the final destination. There is evidence of positive changes towards residential racial integration, but resilience in segregated patterns still remain.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of the hydrogen economy is expected to play a central role in industrial decarbonization, yet little is known about how hydrogen transitions shape labor markets across sectors and regions. This paper examines the formation of hydrogen-related labor markets in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, using job postings as a proxy for recruitment activity. Drawing on socio-technical systems theory and cluster analysis, we identify emerging configurations of actors, competences, and regional specializations. Data was collected from national job portals between August 2023 and September 2024 and analyzed using unsupervised machine learning. Six labor market clusters were identified, showing distinct combinations of recruiting organizations, sectoral focus, and geographical distribution. Engineering jobs—comprising over 40% of the dataset—were also examined in a separate cluster analysis, revealing variation in recruitment needs across technical disciplines and national contexts. Findings suggest that labor market formation is deeply shaped by prior industrial specializations and policy frameworks. Norway’s labor market reflects its offshore energy legacy, dominated by consulting and engineering firms. Denmark shows a capital-concentrated, research-driven pattern, while Sweden’s job creation is led by large incumbents, particularly in energy utilities. The study demonstrates how labor market data can serve as an empirical window into early-stage socio-technical configurations in sustainability transitions. It highlights the potential of combining digital trace data and machine learning to understand regional, sectoral, and competence dynamics in emerging green economies. This approach advances the study of sectoral labor dynamics in energy transitions and offers tools for informing cross-sectoral policy and workforce planning.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of social capital on disaster mitigation and recovery in agriculture. Agriculture not only serves as a means of food production but also provides various ecosystem services to human society. Human society relies on these ecosystem services, and for the realization of a sustainable society, it is essential that agriculture continues even after disasters. This study focused on the role of social capital in disaster mitigation and recovery. Social capital is known to contribute to population recovery and improvements in mental health after disasters. However, its relationship with the recovery of industries such as agriculture has not been extensively studied. This study examines the impact of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck the Noto Peninsula, Japan on January 1, 2024. Using satellite remote sensing, we quantified the effects of the disaster on rice paddy utilization at a micro-geographic level and explored its relationship with social capital. Specifically, we used the annual frequency of village meetings as the proxy variable for social capital and analyze whether differences in meeting frequency influenced post-disaster rice paddy utilization based on a kernel matching with Gaussian process regression. Controlling for potential confounding variables, we found no significant difference in rice paddy utilization associated with variations in meeting frequency. Although social capital is widely regarded as an important factor for disaster mitigation and recovery, our analysis did not find a significant association between social capital and the recovery or mitigation of agricultural land use. This study not only contributes to the theoretical development of social capital but also serves as a pioneering example of applying satellite remote sensing in social science research, demonstrating the significance of this innovative methodology.",

There has been growing attention to the long-term consequences of housing policies and practices on social and economic outcomes, including residential segregation, but comparatively less attention to other aspects of the built environment, such as road networks and spatial (dis)connectivity. In this article, we introduce a novel method that constructs counterfactual road networks by identifying missing road segments that we would expect to exist in a city's road network, given the surrounding infrastructure. We demonstrate the empirical application of the method by analyzing differences in racial composition and residential segregation for the observed and counterfactual road networks of five U.S. cities. We find that unexpected disconnectivity in a city's road network is associated with greater differences in the racial composition of nearby areas and higher levels of segregation at the local and city level. Our findings suggest that road networks warrant more attention as a factor that may contribute to the persistence of segregation.",

However, empirical research on the association between social mobility and health has yielded inconsistent findings. Drawing on data from the 1958 British National Child Development Study and applying Diagonal Reference Models, this paper examines the association between intergenerational and intragenerational mobility with multiple mental, physical, and behavioural health outcomes. We find compelling evidence for acculturation processes: socially mobile individuals’ health outcomes are largely shaped by both their class of origin and destination, with limited evidence of additional, independent mobility effects. The only exception is women experiencing upward intragenerational mobility, who benefit from improved self-rated health beyond what is explained by their origin and destination class (0.10 higher, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.20). Across outcomes, psychological wellbeing, psychological distress, and life satisfaction are strongly tied to destination class, whereas physical health and health behaviours remain closely tied to origin class. We also observe gendered effects: women’s health is more consistently shaped by early life class than men’s. Overall, our empirical findings challenge the theoretical notion that movement between social classes necessarily undermines health.",

Funds are scarce, competition is fierce, the individual future within academia is unknown—the Publish or Perish narrative claims that if you just keep publishing, you can overcome these obstacles. This narrative is perpetuated among aspiring scholars and creates peer pressure where it exerts its power to a certain extent regardless of material requirements, especially in the humanities. Based on extensive discussion of literature and data from a qualitative study with humanities scholars in Germany and the UK, employing a cultural sociological approach, I trace the meaning of Publish or Perish as this narrative. I look at how it is passed on among early career scholars, and how senior scholars respond to it in situations of mentorship and supervision. This perspective emphasizes the importance of everyday situations that trigger anxiety, as well as the importance of mentorship as a crucial means of reducing such anxiety. This is pertinent to reforms of evaluation practices that tend to abstract from such mundane situations. The notion of the slippery slope (Hartmut Rosa) helps comprehend this anxiety.",

        "abstract": "The United States has undergone dramatic shifts in education over the last 60 years, with a rapid expansion of college attainment and the reversal of the gender gap in education, but their impact on educational assortative mating is unclear. Educational assortative mating shapes the distribution of resources within and between families, thereby influencing gender and family inequality. Though some scholars have posited that the decline in couples in which men have the educational advantage reflects “the end of hypergamy,” broader partnership trends complicate this narrative. Without understanding how educational expansion, women’s advantage in attainment, and increased singlehood contribute to trends in assortative mating, I argue such speculation is premature. I take a long-term perspective on the role these factors played in changing educational assortative mating and singlehood and assess whether shifts in population composition influence the future of partnership and singlehood. I present estimates of hypergamy, homogamy, hypogamy, and singlehood between 1960-2020 and leverage multi-dimensional population projections that incorporate educational attainment to estimate six future scenarios of change through 2050. Findings suggest the strong possibility of mating squeezes due to mismatches between men and women’s educational attainment and partnership preferences. I conclude that hypergamy, though changed, is far from ending.",

        "abstract": "While Deep Human-AI Co-Creation (DHACC) empowers innovation, it also harbors the latent risk of \"algorithmic domestication\"—a potential negative trajectory within the broader process of human adaptation to powerful AI tools, as conceptualized within Human-AI Co-becoming (HAC) [L]. This paper defines and critically explores this risk, conceptualizing it as a socio-technical process where users, interacting with algorithmic systems (especially powerful generative AI), under specific conditions (e.g., strong efficiency pressures, lack of critical awareness, opaque system design, platform incentives favoring predictability [H], workplace surveillance and performance metrics), may gradually and non-autonomously narrow their thinking patterns, expressive range, and value considerations to align with perceived algorithmic affordances or limitations, often operating below full conscious reflection. Crucially, this potential non-autonomous cognitive narrowing, partly facilitated by AI's computational nature (pattern dependence, lack of deep understanding [P]), poses a specific threat to capabilities associated with \"Existential Redundancy\" (ER) [F], such as cognitive independence, nuanced creativity, and critical reflection. Drawing upon critical theory, STS, labor process theory, governmentality studies, media studies, and cognitive science, this paper analyzes potential mechanisms (efficiency heuristics, pattern fixation risks amplified by AI's computational nature [P], cognitive offloading trade-offs, effects of algorithmic governance [H]) and discusses theoretically deduced multi-level consequences (potential erosion of cognitive independence/ER [F], risks to cultural diversity [A], societal concerns). Acknowledging that users are active agents who strategically adapt, learn, and resist, the paper emphasizes how structural factors (including platform incentives, power dynamics [H], and managerial rationalities) and system design can nevertheless create conditions conducive to domestication risks. It distinguishes this potential negative pathway from beneficial, autonomous adaptation and skill acquisition. Finally, it proposes multi-level strategies focused on fostering critical awareness, metacognition, and human-centered design prioritizing user agency (as advocated in HAC [L]) and long-term well-being to mitigate risks and safeguard ER [N], while highlighting the need for empirical research investigating the conditions under which domestication occurs and the effectiveness of counter-domestication strategies. This paper aims to raise critical awareness of the potential specter of algorithmic domestication, advocating for reflective design and proactive mitigation within the EST framework [R].

        "abstract": "\"Existential Redundancy\" (ER), defined in [F] as quality dimensions transcending direct utility that constitute the core of human experiential depth (e.g., meaning generation, intrinsic value judgment, aesthetic appreciation, affective depth), forms a cornerstone of the Existential Symbiosis Theory [R]. However, the initial formulation risks ethnocentrism if not critically examined across cultures. This paper deeply explores the complex tension between the potential universality of the capacities underlying ER and its culturally specific manifestations and valuations. It first reviews biological and psychological evidence supporting a potential universal basis for the human potential for ER dimensions (e.g., meaning-seeking drive, basic affective systems, cognitive creativity), while carefully refining the connotation of \"redundancy\" as beyond immediate, instrumental needs. Subsequently, the core part focuses on comparatively analyzing (based primarily on secondary literature, acknowledging inherent limitations) the significant differences in the concrete manifestations, cultural meanings, and value priorities of key ER dimensions across diverse cultural backgrounds, moving beyond simple dichotomies (like individualistic vs. collectivistic) to incorporate nuanced insights from comparative philosophy and anthropology. Furthermore, the paper explores the interactive mechanisms between universal human potentials and specific cultural environments (including language, social structures, and ecological contexts) that co-shape the diverse expressions of ER, considering the complex impacts of globalization and global power structures [H]. Building on this comparison, the paper undertakes profound theoretical reflection, critically examining potential Western-centric biases within the initial ER concept [F], acknowledging the risks of constructing overly simplistic universal theories, and exploring pathways towards developing ER as a more culturally sensitive meta-framework, explicitly incorporating relationality and contextuality. Methodological challenges for future cross-cultural ER research are discussed. This paper argues that cross-cultural scrutiny of ER is essential for refining the concept, enhancing its validity and applicability (e.g., in [N], [G]), avoiding cultural misinterpretation and epistemic violence, and promoting genuine cross-cultural understanding within the broader context of navigating human-AI relations [P].",

        "authors": "Kwok, Yiu Hung",
        "created": "2025-04-23",
        "abstract": "Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics primarily focuses on AI either as a tool to be designed (emphasizing principles like fairness, transparency, accountability - FAccT) or as a potential adversary to be controlled (focusing on alignment, existential risk). While essential, this individual-centric ethical perspective faces significant limitations in grasping the systemic, relational, dynamic, and long-term impacts of AI as it deeply embeds within society, particularly within the complex political economies and power structures that shape its development and deployment. This paper argues for the necessity and value of complementing existing frameworks with an \"ecological turn\" for AI ethics, drawing critically on niche construction theory, technophenomenology, distributed cognition, complex systems thinking, and crucially, integrating deep insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS), critical political economy, sociology, and postcolonial theory. It critiques the limitations of solely relying on traditional perspectives when addressing deep human-AI integration and co-evolutionary dynamics (as explored in HAC [L]). The ecological perspective reframes AI not merely as an instrument but metaphorically as a key actor—a **\"niche partner\" or \"environment engineer\"**¹—whose significant shaping capacity stems from its computational abilities [P] but whose deployment, goals, operational logic, and effects are inextricably linked with embedded and contested power structures (e.g., platform capitalism, surveillance capitalism, state interests, geopolitical dynamics, control over data flows and critical infrastructure) demanding rigorous critical attention. This reframing highlights how AI actively shapes human cognitive, social, and cultural niches, often in ways that reproduce or exacerbate existing inequalities and create novel forms of algorithmic governance and social sorting. Building on this structurally informed analysis, rooted in a critique of platform power and surveillance capitalism, the paper outlines an ecological framework as a complementary lens for AI ethics. It explores potential multi-dimensional considerations for assessing human-AI-environment ecosystem dynamics and overall well-being (termed \"health\" heuristically, encompassing cognitive diversity [potentially threatened by P'], cultural resilience [A], social capital, cognitive autonomy, the space for Existential Redundancy (ER) [F] (understood in its phenomenological and biological depth), system adaptability, social equity, and environmental sustainability), explicitly acknowledging the immense operationalization challenges and positioning these considerations primarily as ways to inform and enrich the application of established principles [N] and human rights frameworks. It explores ecological governance principles (regulation focusing on dynamics, adaptation, systemic responsibility, structural interventions such as robust antitrust enforcement, democratic data governance models, public options for infrastructure, and participatory mechanisms, complementing individual accountability), emphasizing their potential to enhance existing governance approaches [I] and highlighting implementation challenges, political contestation, and the deep-seated nature of structural barriers. This paper argues that the ecological turn provides a vital analytical framework and critical perspective for understanding AI's long-term, systemic impacts and fostering sustainable, just, and human-flourishing coexistence within the Existential Symbiosis Theory [R], thereby offering necessary theoretical depth and practical foresight to complement and strengthen existing ethical governance paradigms.",

        "abstract": "Background: In the absence of high-quality data, the death tolls of epidemics, conflicts, and disasters are often estimated using ad hoc methods. One understudied class of methods, which we term the growth rate discontinuity method (GRDM), estimates death tolls by projecting pre-crisis and post-crisis total population estimates using crude growth rates and then subtracting the results. Despite, or perhaps due to, its simplicity, this method is the source of prominent death toll estimates for the Black Death, the 1918 influenza pandemic, the Great Chinese Famine, and the Rwandan genocide, among others. Objective: In this article, we review the influence and validity of GRDM and its applications. Methods: Using statistical simulation and comparison with better-validated demographic methods, we assess the accuracy, precision, and biases of this method for estimating mortality in absolute and relative terms. Results: We find that existing GRDM estimates often misestimate death tolls by large, unpredictable margins. Simulations suggest this is because GRDM requires precision in its inputs to an extent rarely possible in the contexts of interest. Conclusions: If there is sufficient data to specify GRDM well, it is probably possible to also use a more reliable method; if there is not sufficient data, GRDM estimates are so sensitive to their assumptions that they cannot be considered informative. Contribution: These findings question the empirical suitability of existing demographic and econometric work that has used GRDM to analyse mortality crises. They also underscore the need for improved data collection in crisis settings and the utility of qualitative methods in contexts where quantification using better-validated methods is not possible.",

This module on the first reproductive experience aims to enhance our understanding of women’s and men’s reproductive realities today. Collecting survey items on the first reproductive experience enables researchers to identify the reproductive issues women and men face, the ways in which they respond or tackle these challenges including infertility treatments, and the consequences for different aspects of their lives, including mental health, relationship stability and family size. It also allows researchers to chart the age at which people start trying to have a child and to quantify the incidence of reproductive difficulty in different settings. Finally, by asking about the age at or time between events (trying, conceiving, giving birth), it is possible to estimate success rates according to the age at which the person first tried to conceive a child, an important contribution to human reproduction research for which we currently lack data. Adding a module on the first reproductive experience to cross-sectional and panel family surveys that already contain basic information on fertility will help to integrate the studies of reproductive and demographic events and fill important gaps in knowledge about reproductive health in countries with later fertility.",

The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

Events also combined sexual activities with additional social elements and attracted attendees from greater distances, indicating high commitment to the community lifestyle.

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI and social algorithms, is intervening in cultural production and dissemination in unprecedented ways, acting as a powerful factor within cultural ecosystems [H]. This paper proposes a theoretical perspective examining AI's dual role, acting metaphorically as both a potential catalyst for novelty and a significant filter shaping cultural transmission, with impacts extending far beyond mere efficiency gains. Drawing critically on cultural evolution theory, social network analysis, and computational social science (using concepts like 'variation' and 'selection' heuristically, while emphasizing human agency and AI's computational nature [P]), this paper analyzes the mechanisms through which AI can, depending on its design, deployment context (shaped by political economy [H]), and crucially, human interaction and interpretation, influence the introduction of new cultural elements and the propagation of specific cultural traits. It explores the potential long-term dynamical consequences for cultural symbols, narratives, value norms, collective memory, and meaning systems, paying particular attention to potential pressures on dimensions of \"Existential Redundancy\" (ER) [F] (e.g., potentially marginalizing deep meaning generation or diverse aesthetic expression) and acknowledging the significant empirical challenges in isolating AI's causal impact. The paper critically analyzes the risk of \"algorithmic cultural hegemony\"—where platform-controlled algorithms reflecting specific commercial logics and power structures [H] might foster cultural homogenization—emphasizing this as a socio-technical phenomenon contingent on human choices and structural forces, not an autonomous action by AI, while also acknowledging possibilities for resistance, hybridity, and niche formation. Finally, it discusses the necessity, principles, trade-offs, and structural barriers associated with designing more human-controllable, value-sensitive AI systems and implementing governance strategies aimed at fostering healthier, more resilient cultural ecosystems, acknowledging the centrality of human agency (even as it is reshaped) and societal choices in navigating these processes within the broader Existential Symbiosis Theory [R].

        "abstract": "Objective: The study examines the challenges that nursing faculty encounter in integrating technology in nursing in Dubai. Knowledge of these barriers from the faculty’s perspective can be useful in developing ways of integrating and implementing technology in nursing education. Methods: A quantitative study design was used; interviews were conducted with nursing faculty through purposive sampling. The interviews centred on the perceived barriers to the integration of educational technologies. After codifying the data, manual thematic analysis was conducted, and the findings regarding institutional, technical, and pedagogical themes were compiled. Ethical considerations included informed consent, confidentiality, and institutional review board approval. Results: Thematic analysis revealed five main barriers: (1) institutional limitations, such as inadequate infrastructure and training, (2) technical skill gaps among faculty, (3) concerns about the pedagogical effectiveness of technology in skill-based learning, (4) resistance to change, particularly among senior faculty, and (5) perceived impacts on student engagement. Direct quotations from participants illustrated the complexity of these challenges. Conclusions: Overcoming the barriers requires multifaceted assistance with professional development, technological advancements of facilities, and balanced instructional integration of technologies. These results indicate that the faculty’s insights should be taken into account when developing strategies for technology integration and the role of a constructive organizational context regarding the successful implementation of technologies. Subsequent studies should examine these barriers in different regions and incorporate students’ experiences as well to gain a more holistic understanding.",

        "abstract": "There is a widespread belief, in scholarly literature, the popular press, and even incel ideology, that polygyny prevents many men from marrying, by skewing the sex ratios of marriage markets. In turn, high proportions of men permanently excluded from marriage are thought to lead to negative outcomes, such as increased rates of crime and conflict. We investigate the link between polygyny and unmarried men through a combination of formal demographic modeling and analysis of census data from 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, plus the historical United States. Our model demonstrates that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine under a range of realistic demographic scenarios to support some level of polygyny without necessarily locking any men out of marriage. In fact, our empirical results show a negative association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men at the sub-national level. This pattern is explained partly by differences in sex ratios across populations and partly by relatively strong pro-marriage norms increasing the overall rate of marriage in polygynous communities. These results challenge the “if one man marries two women, another man will go unmarried” mechanism that is commonly invoked to link polygyny to armed conflict, to argue for the evolutionary fitness of monogamy, and to bolster certain strains of incel ideology.",

        "abstract": "Existing research suggests that people employ fluid understandings of infidelity and conceptualise it in relation to, for example, emotional outcomes rather than as a static set of (physical) behaviours. Seeking to explore the underlying mechanisms of this process, this article examines how emotions are negotiated in conceptualisations and meanings of infidelity. This question is investigated through a thematic analysis of 17 semi-structured interviews with young adults in England who experienced, according to their perspective, infidelity. I show that not only what participants did but also how they or their partner felt was invoked in classifying a practice as infidelity. Namely, emotions serve as a cultural repertoire to negotiate infidelity by drawing on internalised feeling rules in relation to genuine, ‘lived’ feelings. However, the presence and absence of feelings are drawn on differently in that emotions are only invoked in conceptualising what is not infidelity – rather than what it is. Against this background, I argue that we need to examine not only when and why people engage in emotion work but equally when they instead engage in assigning a (new) frame to a practice. By showcasing what people say or think about infidelity as well as their lived experiences, this article underlines the need to explore both discourse and practice – and their interplay – in research on infidelity.",

Our research highlights a complex array of positive and negative implications of EdTech. Based on these findings we suggest ten design proposals that could help inform the design of future EdTech for secondary schools. The proposals are based on our extensive ethnographic research in six purposively sampled secondary schools which are geographically, economically, culturally and technically varied, where we examined the varied kinds of EdTech that were used and the social and educational implications of this use.",

        "authors": "Kwok, Yiu Hung",
        "created": "2025-04-23",
        "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Generative AI (AIGC), presents unprecedented disruptions and challenges to global education systems. The increasing prevalence of students using AI for rapid answers and task completion raises significant concerns about learning depth, foundational skill acquisition, and the cultivation of future-ready competencies. This paper argues that merely banning or passively allowing AI use are ineffective responses; a fundamental reshaping of educational goals and paradigms is crucial. It proposes that \"Existential Redundancy\" (ER) [F]—the qualities transcending direct utility that constitute the core of human experiential depth, meaning-making, and value judgment (e.g., meaning generation, intrinsic value judgment, aesthetic appreciation, non-utilitarian creativity, affective depth, existential awareness)—should be positioned as a central value and key objective in future education, complementing the development of higher-order cognitive skills. Adopting an ER perspective derived from the Existential Symbiosis Theory [R], this paper analyzes the severe challenges AI poses to education, particularly the risks of \"intellectual shallowing,\" a potential \"skill gap,\" and the threat of \"algorithmic domestication\" [P'] to students' cognitive autonomy, partly stemming from AI's computational limits [P]. Building on this analysis, it constructs a future learning paradigm for human-AI symbiosis with the dual, mutually reinforcing goals of fostering higher-order cognitive skills and safeguarding/cultivating ER-related capacities [F, N]. This paradigm comprises five interconnected pillar strategies: (1) cultivating critical AI literacy and digital citizenship (understanding AI limits [P] and risks [P']); (2) transforming instructional design (emphasizing \"beyond-AI\" tasks targeting ER [F], while judiciously leveraging AI's assistive potential); (3) innovating assessment methods (prioritizing qualitative, process-oriented approaches for ER-related growth, acknowledging measurement challenges [C]); (4) igniting intrinsic motivation (linking learning to ER [F]); and (5) empowering teachers and providing systemic support (addressing equity challenges [H] and structural barriers). This paper aims to provide policymakers, educators, and researchers with a theoretically grounded framework and practical pathways to navigate the educational challenges of the AI era, ensuring education not only adapts to the future technological landscape but also steadfastly upholds and cultivates the core values of being human [N].",

        "abstract": "The paper investigates the deployment of data analytics and machine learning to improve welding quality in Tecnomulipast srl, a small-to-medium sized manufacturing firm located in Puglia, Italy. The firm produces food machine components and more recently mechanized its laser welding process with the introduction of an IoT-enabled system integrating photographic control. The investment, underwritten by the Apulia Region under PIA (Programmi Integrati di Agevolazione) allowed Tecnomulipast to not only mechanize its production line but also embark upon wider digital transformation. This involved the creation of internal data analytics infrastructures that have the capability to underpin machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. This paper addresses a prediction of weld bead width (LC) with a dataset of 1,000 observations. Input variables are laser power (PL), pulse time (DI), frequency (FI), beam diameter (DF), focal position (PF), travel speed (VE), trajectory accuracy (TR), laser angle (AN), gas flow (FG), gas purity (PG), ambient temperature (TE), and penetration depth (PE). The parameters were exploited to build and validate some supervised machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and Linear Regression. The performance of the models was measured by MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R². Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Boosting performed the highest. Feature importance analysis determined that laser power, gas flow, and trajectory accuracy are the key variables. This project showcases the manner in which Tecnomulipast has benefited from public investment to introduce digital transformation and adopt data-driven strategies within Industry 4.0.",

        "abstract": "How has public discourse about climate change evolved? This paper answers this question through the paradigmatic case of British heatwaves. These are traditionally considered a fortunate break from dull weather, making them a least likely case for the emergency of a discourse of doom. With a topic-modeling analysis of British national newspaper articles on heatwaves from 1985 until 2023 (N = 35,127), we show that a longstanding Romantic heatwave discourse eventually buckled, and that Apocalypticism finally became the dominant genre in the last decade. A supplementary hermeneutic analysis then indicates and explains complexity within this broad trend. 1980s stories already noted routine heatwave problems, while many recent ones continue depicting positive lifestyle implications. Within the Apocalyptic genre itself climate change is today deemed a factual causal force, whereas in the 1980s and 1990s it was a possible carrier of future dangers. In connecting the genre perspective from literature theory to to the big data method topic modelling, our approach is parsimonious, novel and replicable in other national contexts.",

        "authors": "Harshit Mishra",
        "created": "2025-04-14",
        "abstract": "Natural resource management (NRM) is a rapidly growing field, with global spending on NRM estimated to reach $1.2 trillion by 2030. India is one of the world's most resource-rich countries, with abundant reserves of coal, iron ore, bauxite, and other minerals. NRM is a complex and crucial aspect of sustainable development, and the effective integration of dual production and livestock grazing has emerged as a promising strategy in this domain. This chapter provides an overview of the economic benefits derived from the implementation of these practices, considering the various challenges and opportunities involved. The concept of dual production involves the simultaneous cultivation of crops and the rearing of livestock within the same agricultural system. This integrated approach has gained traction due to its potential for increased productivity and resource optimization. Historical perspectives reveal the evolution of dual production strategies, which include crop-livestock integration, silvopastoral systems, and diverse agroforestry approaches. While these strategies offer significant benefits, they also pose unique challenges that necessitate careful management and planning. Livestock grazing, as a major component of NRM, plays a crucial role in sustaining agricultural ecosystems. Different grazing systems, such as rotational grazing, continuous grazing, and adaptive grazing management, have varying implications for ecological balance and agricultural productivity. Despite its benefits, livestock grazing can have adverse environmental impacts, making it imperative to carefully consider the economics of these practices. The economic benefits of dual production are multifaceted, encompassing increased productivity and efficiency, diversified income streams, resource optimization, and reduced input costs. By leveraging market opportunities and emphasizing value addition, practitioners can enhance their economic returns and strengthen the resilience of their operations. Employing robust economic analysis methods, such as cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and profitability metrics, can provide valuable insights into the long-term economic sustainability of dual production and livestock grazing. Addressing the policy and regulatory considerations associated with dual production and livestock grazing is essential for fostering a conducive environment for sustainable practices. Government incentives and support, coupled with environmental regulations and sustainability standards, can incentivize the adoption of environmentally friendly practices while ensuring compliance with conservation efforts. Furthermore, effective land use planning and zoning play a critical role in optimizing resource allocation and minimizing potential conflicts. Despite its potential, the implementation of dual production and livestock grazing faces many challenges that require careful consideration. Balancing the competing needs of crops and livestock, conserving the environment, preserving biodiversity, and navigating market and trade challenges pose significant hurdles. Building resilience to climate change is also paramount to ensuring the long-term viability of these practices. Looking ahead, embracing technology and innovation, leveraging data and precision agriculture, and catering to the global demand for sustainable agriculture can open up new avenues for growth and development. Investing in research and development to address the evolving needs of dual production and livestock grazing is crucial for ensuring continuous improvements and sustainability in the field of NRM.",

Anchored in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals—particularly \"No Poverty\" and \"Gender Equality\"—the research aims to assess whether SHG participation translates into increased agency and leadership for women. Using qualitative methods, including structured interviews with 46 SHG members and two rounds of Focus Group Discussions, the study evaluates women's role in household and financial decisions. Findings reveal that while women exhibit autonomy in personal and reproductive choices, they remain significantly dependent on male counterparts for financial, asset-related, and political decisions. The proximity to urban Kolkata has not yet translated into significant empowerment, highlighting gaps in training, leadership development, and awareness. The study concludes that targeted sensitisation and capacity-building initiatives are essential to enhance women’s decision-making capabilities and truly harness the potential of SHGs in promoting gender equity.",

        "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges posed by the rapid spread of mis/disinformation, exacerbating societal polarization and institutional distrust. Understanding how mis/disinformation is understood and framed in public discourse is essential to developing strategies for building societal resilience and promoting informed decision-making during crises. Objective: This study explores the use of the terms misinformation and disinformation across Swiss public discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic, examining its framing within newspaper articles and social media interactions. The findings aim to inform policymakers and journalists/communicators on mitigating the societal impact of mis/disinformation through the promotion of a common understanding of the terms misinformation and disinformation. Methods: We analyzed two datasets using an NLP pipeline, including lemmatization, co-occurrence analysis, and semantic network mapping: media articles retrieved via Factiva, and social media posts collected via CrowdTangle. Results: The framing of mis/disinformation varied significantly across the datasets. News media highlighted its role in shaping public sentiment, often discussing the tension between journalistic integrity and the amplification of falsehoods. Social media exhibited polarized narratives, with discussions centered on conspiracy theories, distrust in institutions, and grassroots mobilization. Conclusions: Diverging narratives on the very concepts of mis/disinformation across public discourse reflect broader societal tensions. Robust journalistic integrity in the media, and resilience strategies against mis/disinformation involving empowering publics through information literacy approaches are critical to bridging divides and reducing polarization.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the influence of debt maturity structure on stock price crash risk (SPCR) in African economies, focusing on the moderating role of accounting standards such as the IFRS and national GAAP. Drawing on data from 514 publicly listed non-financial firms across six countries Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, Ghana, and Morocco spanning the period from 2007 to 2020, the research employs generalized least squares panel regression to test its hypotheses. The findings indicate that debt maturity significantly reduces SPCR, with this effect being more pronounced in developing economies where robust accounting standards are better enforced. The study reveals that higher-quality financial reporting frameworks enhance transparency and reduce information asymmetry, thereby amplifying the beneficial impact of debt maturity on SPCR. These insights underscore the critical role of debt maturity and stringent accounting standards in strengthening financial stability and corporate governance. By addressing a notable gap in the literature, this research offers valuable implications for policymakers, regulators, and investors in African markets.",

This study explores how word-of-mouth (WOM) and electronic WOM (eWOM) influence repurchase intentions among MSME consumers. Using a mixed-methods approach that includes structural equation modeling and qualitative insights, the research finds that WOM significantly enhances trust, satisfaction, and perceived value—factors critical to repurchase behavior. Notably, eWOM through social media and online reviews strengthens brand credibility and customer loyalty. The study also emphasizes the advantage of MSME products being culturally relevant and locally rooted, benefiting from authentic consumer recommendations. These findings highlight WOM as a cost-effective marketing strategy for MSMEs with limited promotional budgets. The study suggests that MSMEs should cultivate positive WOM by delivering exceptional customer experiences and leveraging digital platforms.

When chastity is reconceived as a mode of governance that implicates the body in its totality (against the body/spirit binary), it functions as a mechanism for the removal of interpretative power: his body becomes the symbolic embodiment of female Chastity in extramarital contexts, while her body embodies male Chastity within marital structures. These dynamics are further explored through discursive analyses of the teen television series Skam, the contemporary novels White Noise and Fang Si-Chi’s First Love Paradise, and the ideological trajectories of the 6B4T feminist movement and Redpill masculinity.",

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, social scientists have adapted computational methods for qualitative text analysis, with the hope that they can match the accuracy and reliability of hand coding. The emergence of GPT and open-source generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed this process by shifting from programming to engaging with models using natural language, potentially mimicking the in-depth, inductive and/or iterative process of qualitative analysis. We test the ability of generative LLMs to replicate and augment traditional qualitative coding, experimenting with multiple prompt structures across four closed- and open-source generative LLMs and proposing a workflow for conducting qualitative coding with generative LLMs. We find that LLMs can perform nearly as well as prior supervised machine learning models in accurately matching hand-coding output. Moreover, using generative LLMs as a natural language interlocutor closely replicates traditional qualitative methods, indicating their potential to transform the qualitative research process, despite ongoing challenges.",

        "abstract": "This article critically examines the prevalent narrative of \"AI exceptionalism\"—the belief that artificial intelligence constitutes an ontological rupture from previous technologies and human cognitive extensions. Drawing from decolonial theory and the enactive approach, I interrogate how metaphorical framings of AI as radical novelty, inevitable progress, and autonomous agent serve specific economic and political interests while obscuring historical continuities. Rather than representing a fundamental break, I argue that contemporary AI functions primarily as a powerful magnifier that accelerates existing colonial-modern epistemologies and extractivist knowledge patterns. By analyzing AI through the lens of extended cognition theory, I reposition these technologies within the historical continuum of human cognitive extensions, from early writing systems to computational tools, while acknowledging their distinctive emergent agential properties. This reconceptualization has profound implications for academic praxis, suggesting the need for a critical cognitive sovereignty—neither rejecting AI tools nor uncritically depending on them, but engaging them reflexively, holding the center of meaning-making within our subjective experience. By demythologizing AI exceptionalism, we can recognize our own tendency to fear invasion, abduction, and rapture, thereby recovering a more nuanced understanding of human-technology relationships and reasserting our collective agency in shaping technological futures toward democratically chosen ends.",

        "abstract": "This research paper examines Arundhati Roy's novels and feminism, using the theories of Helene Cixous and Simon de Beauvoir. Cixous and de Beauvoir's theories are relevant in understanding contemporary feminist issues, addressing patriarchal structures, and promoting global gender equality through activism and media representation. The 1990s saw a postmodern shift in feminist thought, leading to Third-Wave feminism, which sought to be traced in Roy's novels. However, scholars have debated that a new wave of feminism has arrived since 2012 and is characterized by social media activism and radical individualism in the women's world. Roy's second fiction, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, was published in 2017, 20 years after her first novel, The God of Small Things. Roy has only published two works of fiction throughout her career. Her first novel, The God of Small Things, falls within the Third-Wave feminism era, while her second, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, falls within the Fourth-Wave feminism era. The study aims to evaluate Roy's novels on the spectrum of these two waves of feminism and sketch the definition and parameters of these distinct waves. By examining Roy's novels about feminism, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of her writings and the broader feminist movement.",

Our focus is building a case as to its usefulness to support the research process as an assistant to the researcher, rather than to replace the intellectual rigour needed to conduct credible grounded theory research. To aid this, we present a framework for using ChatGPT to assist researchers’ decision making and analysis. By structuring the analytical process into clear research phases - from initial coding through to visualisation and expansion - and providing specific prompts and instructions for each phase, the framework enables researchers to systematically harness AI capabilities whilst maintaining the methodological rigour and accountability of the researcher in leading this process. We argue that the framework's strength lies in its careful alignment with established grounded theory processes, particularly in its emphasis on constant comparison throughout all analytical phases. As many grounded theory methods are employed in other qualitative research designs, we argue that the proposed framework may have potential for use in a broad range of designs, however, we also suggest that this is the start of new conversations about how researchers can harness AI to assist their decision making and intellectual work, processes which can never be fully replaced.",

        "authors": "Kwok, Yiu Hung",
        "created": "2025-04-23",
        "abstract": "Deep Human-AI Collaborative Creation (DHACC) is reshaping creative fields but introduces significant ethical and legal challenges, including difficulties in contribution attribution, blurred authorship, originality questions, and accountability gaps, as analyzed in [Q]. Existing high-level AI ethics principles often lack direct applicability to these complex, dynamic interactions occurring within specific socio-technical ecosystems [H]. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an operationalized ethical governance framework specifically tailored for DHACC, grounded in the Existential Symbiosis Theory (EST) [R]. Recognizing AI's computational limits [P] and the importance of human Existential Redundancy (ER) [F, N], this framework aims to foster responsible innovation while mitigating risks. It integrates five core, interconnected mechanisms: (1) Context-Aware Review and Audit Protocols (integrating EIA principles focusing on ER impacts [N] and risks like algorithmic domestication [P']); (2) Human-Centric Contribution Attribution Systems (emphasizing documentation/declaration of human creative control, acknowledging AI's computational role [P] and rejecting AI co-authorship [Q]); (3) Robust Provenance Tracking Infrastructure (addressing traceability challenges posed by AI generation [P]); (4) Adaptive Intellectual Property (IP) Approaches (focusing on clarifying human rights in DHACC, cautiously exploring licensing/normative solutions over radical IP reform); and (5) Multi-level Accountability Structures (anchoring responsibility in humans [Q], addressing platform power [H] and opacity [O]). The paper details the design rationale, theoretical underpinnings (drawing on [P, F, N, L, H]), potential tools, and guiding principles for each mechanism, emphasizing their synergistic function. It thoroughly analyzes the significant challenges and normative tensions confronting the framework's implementation (technical feasibility [O, C], balancing innovation with ethics, legal lag, potential capture by powerful actors [H], global coordination, enforcement difficulties), advocating for a multi-stakeholder, adaptive governance approach combining hard law, soft law, and community norms. This operationalized framework offers a concrete pathway towards fostering responsible DHACC practices, aiming for ethical alignment [N] and sustainable co-existence within complex socio-technical ecosystems [H]",

        "abstract": "This article explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and reconstructive qualitative social research, posing how AI can support complex interpretation processes in this field. The proposed method, Reconstructive Social Research Prompting (RSRP), aims to leverage AI to interpret empirical materials that are intersubjectively verifiable. The paper outlines the distinctive characteristics of qualitative social research and its differentiation from quantitative methods, emphasizing the importance of basic and object theories, methodologies, and methods. Chapter 2 discusses these dimensions, highlighting the conceptual distinctions and the importance of theoretical and empirical components. Chapter 3 introduces the creation of RSRP prompts, focusing on dynamic practices like chain-of-thought and train-of-thought prompting to guide AI in interpreting qualitative data. The article presents an architecture for these prompts, detailing the iterative process between the researcher and AI to refine interpretations. Chapter 4 theorizes concepts by presenting an example from a current research project. This example demonstrates the practical application of RSRP in analyzing group discussions, showcasing how AI can generate meaningful interpretations. In conclusion, this article underscores the transformative potential of RSRP for the qualitative research community. It highlights how this method can significantly enhance the efficiency and depth of qualitative analysis and emphasizes its practical benefits. The article suggests that through collaborative and iterative processes, AI can evolve into a partner in qualitative research, challenging traditional notions of intelligence and interpretation and paving the way for more insightful research.",

The analysis reveals strikingly linear trends in record ageing, particularly for the share aged 65+ and mean age, underscoring a linear increase in the upper bounds of ageing at the local level. In contrast, the prospective dependency ratio shows more varied patterns. The identity of record-holding municipalities also varies, with Denmark and Iceland showing stable leaders and Sweden, Finland, and Norway displaying more variety. This study provides a novel municipal-level perspective on population ageing in the Nordic countries, revealing substantive differences within and between countries in how record-oldest municipalities evolve.",

        "authors": "Kwok, Yiu Hung",
        "created": "2025-04-23",
        "abstract": "Traditional Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) primarily focuses on usability, efficiency, and user experience. However, as Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into human cognition and life, particularly within complex socio-technical ecosystems shaped by powerful platforms [H], the limitations of this paradigm become apparent. Critiques grounded in the computational limits of AI [P] and the unique nature of human Existential Redundancy (ER) [F] suggest the traditional \"tool\" metaphor is insufficient. This paper argues for an extension from HCI to a more profound theoretical framework: HAC (Human-AI Co-becoming). Distinguishing itself clearly from \"Symbiotic Intelligence\" [M] (a speculative concept denoting potential emergent system-level intelligence), HAC serves as the design philosophy and interaction framework aimed at ethically guiding the dynamic, mutually shaping, and co-adaptive relationship between humans and AI, moving beyond the simplistic tool metaphor towards responsible co-evolution. This paper first critiques the inadequacies of traditional HCI goals in addressing deep human-AI integration within power-laden contexts [H]. Subsequently, it elaborates the theoretical foundations of HAC, integrating insights from critical AI studies, theories pertinent to symbiosis, ER theory [F], extended/enactive cognition, technophenomenology, and STS (acknowledging power structures [H]). Building upon this, it proposes a design philosophy for HAC, with core objectives of fostering Beneficial Co-adaptation (aligned with human values [N] and ER [F], actively resisting algorithmic domestication [P'] and platform-driven manipulation [H]), Existential Empowerment (safeguarding cognitive autonomy and ER [F, N]), and Relational Health (grounded in transparency about AI limits [P, F, O] and resisting inauthentic simulated relationships). It explores their normative sources, inherent ethical tensions, and the crucial influence of underlying power dynamics [H]. The paper further investigates potential interaction paradigms (e.g., deep coupling interfaces like BCI/XR, critically assessed) and mechanisms (e.g., embedded reflective mechanisms like 'Reflective Friction' as countermeasures to [P']), analyzing their profound ethical implications (including adaptive governance challenges) and cognitive impacts. Finally, it discusses the methodological challenges [C, O] and potential exploratory approaches for characterizing the dynamics and impacts of human-AI co-becoming relationships, emphasizing the limits of measurement and the need for qualitative, context-sensitive methods. This paper aims to provide a novel theoretical foundation and design philosophy for the next generation of human-AI interaction, pioneering a new direction from mere interaction to ethically responsible \"co-becoming.\" Keywords: Human-AI Co-becoming (HAC), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Design Philosophy, Existential Redundancy (ER) [F], Co-adaptation, Existential Empowerment, Relational Health, Cognitive Autonomy, AI Ethics [N], Technophenomenology, Adaptive Governance, Power Dynamics [H], Platform Capitalism [H], Algorithmic Domestication [P'], Reflective Friction, Computational Limits [P], Authenticity Gap [F], Assessment Limits [O, C].",

        "abstract": "The rise of Deep Human-AI Collaborative Creation (DHACC) blurs the lines between creator and tool, posing fundamental challenges to established theories of authorship, intellectual property (IP) regimes (especially copyright), and frameworks for legal and ethical responsibility. This paper delves into the interconnected core issues of authorship, originality, and responsibility attribution within the DHACC context. It first reviews the relevant theoretical and legal dilemmas. Second, it analyzes the difficulties in applying the \"human authorship\" principle and \"originality\" requirements of current copyright law, introducing a \"Human-AI Collaborative Authorship Spectrum\" as an analytical tool. Combining scenario examples and comparisons of key international legal stances (e.g., US Thaler case, China Li v. Liu case, EU position), it explores criteria for recognizing human contribution and rethinking the originality threshold, grounding the analysis firmly in the computational limits of AI [P] (incapable of independent conception) and the nature of human creativity rooted in Existential Redundancy (ER) [F]. Third, drawing explicitly on the ontological arguments from [P] and [F] (AI's lack of understanding, intentionality, and ER), it argues forcefully on philosophical and ethical grounds that current AI lacks the capacity for responsible agency, emphasizing the necessity of anchoring responsibility in humans via a multi-level accountability model that acknowledges power relations [H] and practical complexities (like the \"moral crumple zones\" identified by Elish, exacerbated by algorithmic opacity discussed in [O]). Finally, it examines future adaptation directions (advocating cautious assessment of IP reform, emphasizing the need for operationalized governance frameworks [I] and community norms), integrating a social equity perspective [N]. This paper contends that addressing the rights and responsibility challenges of DHACC requires an interdisciplinary, context-sensitive approach attentive to power and fairness, guided by a clear understanding of AI's computational nature [P] and human uniqueness [F] as elaborated within the Existential Symbiosis Theory [R].",

        "abstract": "Until very recently, innovation in computer systems and biological systems took place independently, partly because they are so characteristically different. For example, computer systems have historically been deterministic and predictable, complicated but not complex, and the artefacts of human design. By contrast, biological systems have been stochastic and often unpredictable, both complicated and complex, and the product of path-dependent evolutionary selection. Nonetheless, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology now blurs these distinctions. For example, self-authoring AI exhibits characteristics, such as learning and surprise, previously associated exclusively with biological systems. Similarly, synthetic biology (SynBio) exhibits characteristics, such as engineered organisms, previously associated computer systems. The rapid convergence of AI and SynBio is accelerating the pace of innovation in both fields in ways that challenge existing governance systems. To date, spirited debates have failed to clarify guidance for policymakers with regard to regulatory standards. In this paper, we assert that conflicts in AI-SynBio convergence will continue to be unproductive until contrasting worldviews – what Costanza called the “pre-analytic vision” -- are explicitly acknowledged by a critical mass of stakeholders. Using the familiar shared experience of science fiction to stimulate the moral imagination, this paper describes oversimplified archetypes that caricature exaggerated views for the purpose of illustrating them. Then, it suggests an alternative approach to arguments that may resolve some controversies and orient technological development pathways towards outcomes that minimize regrets.",

        "authors": "Theodore J Kalaitzidis",

        "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) has not broken higher education. It has revealed that much of it was already broken. This paper argues that the dominant educational paradigm, rooted in formalist models of cognition, no longer serves the needs of a world filled with thinking machines. Learning, long reduced to internal recall and reproduction, must be recalibrated as the capacity to act meaningfully, critically, and creatively with tools in real-world contexts. This is not technological determinism. It’s an attempt to reconcile epistemic insolvency accruing compounding interest. Blending epistemological insight with systems-level critique and practical strategies, the paper exposes the reactive militarization between student evasion and faculty surveillance, and it challenges educators to transform traditional classroom activities with authentic, tool-mediated practice. Drawing from the fields of Learning Sciences and Instructional Design, it explores how GenAI can serve not as a threat to integrity, but as a compounding cognitive artifact: a “thought prosthesis,” a support system that amplifies creativity, an accessibility tool, and an enabler of personalized, real-time learning at scale. The paper proposes a Critical AI Literacy agenda grounded in epistemic awareness. This extends to include practical implementation of RAG tutors, Custom GPTs, interactive generators, student-led content production, and code-based learning; all deployed with an honest reckoning of GenAI’s deficits: semiotic fallacy, fabrication, bias, and ethical opacity. The result is a roadmap not only for responsible integration of GenAI in college classrooms, but for reimagining what education can become when human discernment, creativity, and tool fluency are placed at the center. The ideas within do not present GenAI as a savior or a scourge, but as a mirror allowing us to confront what education has become and inviting us to rebuild something better.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the findings of a collaborative autoethnography designed to deeply explore the question of how qualitative researchers relate to and care for their data. Through our analysis, we find that the emotions we experience when working with data are integral to our (responsible) research practices. These often negative emotions are intertwined with three ways in which care is involved in our data practices: i) our care for data as a means of caring for research participants; ii) our care for data maintenance and infrastructure; and iii) our care for the quality and usefulness of data themselves. As we care for data, our sense of ourselves as scholars ‘co-becomes’ along with them, which strengthens the attachments we have to data. The emotions and caring relations which we identify are often in tension with common expectations for data sharing. We therefore conclude by reflecting on the implications of our findings for how data management and sharing might be carried out in ways that acknowledge the affective nature of research data practices.",

        "abstract": "Current prominent music evolution theories suggest music evolved as a participatory group activity, whose adaptive functions were strengthening and/or signaling social cohesion. However, the prevalence of collective music-making varies substantially across societies, and in some cases is exceptionally rare. Here, we consider hypotheses for three factors which could attenuate collective music-making: diminished collective action more generally, an emphasis on musical expertise, and solo-oriented musical styles. We look at data related to these hypotheses in four societies in which collective music-making is rare: the Tsimane of lowland Bolivia, the Ache of eastern Paraguay, the Ayoreo of Bolivia and Paraguay, and the Tuvans of the Russian Republic of Tyva. Our results suggest that the scale and religiosity of collective action is the most important factor related to the overall degree of collective music-making in a culture. The effect of musical expertise was mostly limited to the dominance of shamans in religious contexts, while well-developed solo musical styles did not necessarily prevent group performance in other social settings. We also note the importance of cultural loss due to influence of invading colonial and imperial forces in diminishing indigenous forms of collective music-making. Notably, in all the cases we consider, episodes of some form of collective music-making do (or historically did) occur during important social events, a fact which supports the group-functionalist view. Our findings also point to the centrality and ubiquity of the religious function of music, and suggest this aspect of musical behavior needs to be better addressed by evolutionary theories of music.",
