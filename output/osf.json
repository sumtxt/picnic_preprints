        "abstract": "Empirical research in the social sciences is often interested in understanding actor stances; the positions that social actors take regarding normative statements in societal discourse. In automated text analysis applications, the classification task of stance detection remains challenging. Stance detection is especially difficult due to semantic challenges such as implicitness or missing context but also due to the general nature of the task. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable stance detection in a generalized (non-domain, non-statement specific) form. Specifically, we test a variety of different general prompt chains for zero-shot stance classifications. Our evaluation data consists of textual data from a real-world empirical research project in the domain of sustainable urban transport. For 1710 German newspaper paragraphs, each containing an organizational entity, we annotated the stance of the entity toward one of five normative statements. A comparison of four publicly available LLMs show that they can improve upon existing approaches and achieve adequate performance. However, results heavily depend on the prompt chain method, LLM, and vary by statement. Our findings have implications for computational linguistics methodology and political discourse analysis, as they offer a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in performing the complex semantic task of stance detection. We strongly emphasise the necessity of domain-specific evaluation data for evaluating LLMs and considering trade-offs between model complexity and performance.",

By “reproduction archive,” we mean the data and code supporting quantitative research articles that allows others to reproduce the computations described in the published paper. We collect a random sample of quantitative research articles published in political science from 1995 to 2022. We find that—even in 2022—most quantitative research articles do not point a reproduction archive. However, practices are improving. In 2014, when the DA-RT symposium was published in PS, about 12% of quantitative research articles point to the data and code. Eight years later, in 2022, that has increased to 31%. This underscores a massive shift in norms, requirements, and infrastructure. Still, only a minority of articles share the supporting data and code. In 2014, Lupia and Alter wrote: “Today, information on the data production and analytic decisions that underlie many published works in political science is unavailable.” They could write the same today; much work remains to be done.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to quantitative information about immigrants or narratives around the costs and benefits of immigration can alter people’s immigration policy preferences. Using a survey experiment with a representative sample of over 5,000 respondents in Australia, we find substantial and contradictory misperceptions across the number, origins and labour market attributes of immigrants. Most respondents prefer less immigration overall, but favour increased high-skilled immigration. Support for increased immigration rises by 4.5—7 percentage points when respondents are shown narratives on how immigrants can help improve housing affordability. Conversely, highlighting the perceived negative impacts of immigration on housing affordability reduces support for increasing or maintaining current immigration levels. Providing quantitative information on immigrants’ characteristics generates smaller increases in support for more immigration than narratives. For immigration from Pacific Island countries, exposure to quantitative information increases support for relaxing visa requirements but there is no evidence that narratives have any effect.",

        "abstract": "Background: The Federalist Society, a leading conservative legal organization, has played a significant role in shaping the American judiciary for decades. Despite its influence, comprehensive empirical data on the organization remains scarce. We address this gap by systematically documenting 20,205 public events hosted by the Society from 1984 to 2024, with substantive coverage from 2007 onward. Methods: Following ethical best practices in data collection and ownership, we gathered event metadata—including titles, dates, locations, sponsors, topics, and speakers—via web scraping from the Federalist Society’s archives. The dataset is structured to facilitate analysis of event trends, co-speaking networks, and thematic shifts over time. To ensure data integrity, we performed validation, deduplication, and cleaning, resulting in a well-structured, high-quality dataset. Conclusions: This dataset provides an empirical foundation for examining the Federalist Society’s role in legal discourse. It is a resource for scholars in law, political science, sociology, gender studies, network science, and computational social science, enabling investigations into key themes of discussion, event participation patterns, demographic diversity, professional backgrounds, and more. Researchers can use it to study institutional influence, legal networks, and the evolution of conservative legal thought.",

Our study explores the relationship between distributive social justice and environmental attitudes among young people in the context of climate change. Using a natural experimental design, we examine how the 2021 European Floods influenced social justice and environmental attitudes. Our results indicate significant shifts in attitudes, particularly regarding social justice, following the flooding. We found a strong and robust relationship between social justice and environmental attitudes. A causal mediation analysis revealed that floods affected environmental attitudes indirectly through social justice attitudes beyond direct effects. Our results emphasise the importance of integrating the principles of justice in addressing climate change and suggest that young people’s perspectives on social justice play a crucial role in shaping environmental policies and responses to climate crises.",

        "abstract": "This essay discusses two interrelated questions that have emerged in recent international relations literature, ‘How do states think?’ and ‘How do we know what states think?’, with an empirical focus on the Indo-Pacific. Lurking behind these questions is often the assumption that states are rational actors. This essay will therefore examine the concept of rationality, the state of the art about the rationality of states, and the strategic thinking of several states in the Indo-Pacific. I argue that it is the observer’s approach to a state that determines the state’s rationality according to Mearsheimer and Rosato’s homo theoreticus benchmarks, which model states as machines and angels rather than humans. When seen as rich tapestries rather than black boxes, states in the Indo-Pacific often violate this rationality standard. Based on insights from cognitive science, I suggest some directions for rethinking the rationality of foreign policy and reconceptualising the rational actor assumption.",

        "abstract": "As climate change has become more important to voters and political parties over the last decade in Europe, this paper asks whether public opinion on the issue has become more politicised, in the sense of being more closely linked to either party support or left-right identity. We consider change from Wave 8 (2016-17) to Wave 10 (2020-22) of the European Social Survey (ESS). Climate consciousness increased overall, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. Politicisation of climate change increased mostly in Western Europe, where it increased more on the left, and for left-wing party voters, than on the right. Populist-Right parties were distinctive in the relative stability of climate consciousness among their voters. Our results show increased politicisation of climate change attitudes within Western European countries, but also convergence between polities of the East and West at higher levels of climate consciousness, which may affect EU climate policy making.",

Political inefficiencies arise whenever the ex-ante preferred policy is sufficiently likely to become unpopular after its implementation and policy learning is valuable enough.",

        "abstract": "In Venezuela, numerous armed groups known as sindicatos have taken advantage of the weakness of the central state to control mining areas. In so doing, these groups have established forms of rentier micro-states by maintaining sovereign functions (police, tax, customs, etc.) and taking over public services (water, electricity, health, education, transport, etc.). In this contribution, we provocatively ask to what extent such rentier micro-states can be deemed disposable. Through an ethnographic and documentary study of the Las Claritas mining area, we consider that, if they are indeed disposable, it is not so much because the Venezuelan state can dispose of them at will (although a coup de force by the Venezuelan army should not be excluded), but rather because the political organization required for mining can cease to exist once the subsoil resources have been depleted, thereby turning these areas into vulnerable and potentially ephemeral rentier micro-states.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the concept, measurement, principal stylized facts, and theoretical aspects of compositional inequality. Compositional inequality refers to how the shares of capital and labor income vary along the income distribution. This analysis is valuable for several reasons. From a macroeconomic perspective, it elucidates the link between functional and personal distributions of income, which is crucial for addressing the drivers of income inequality in a context rising capital share. From a comparative economic perspective, it locates economic systems on the continuum between two extremes: classical capitalism, where the rich earn predominantly from capital and the poor from labor, and new capitalism, where the composition of capital and labor is uniform across the distribution. We refer to the entire range of systems along this continuum as the distributional varieties of capitalism. Recent empirical studies indicate that, in most countries, we are far from classical capitalism, though with notable exceptions, such as Latin American countries. This underscores the need to evaluate the benefits of compositional equality. The paper concludes that compositional equality is desirable for at least two reasons: it promotes fairness and supports an inclusive, profit-driven regime of accumulation and growth.

        "abstract": "We use cultural evolutionary models to examine how individual experiences and culturally-inherited information jointly shape risk attitudes under environmental uncertainty. We find that learning processes not only generate plausible variation in risk attitudes, but also that conservative learning strategies---emphasizing the preservation of generational knowledge---excel in high-risk environments, promoting stable wealth accumulation and long-term survival but limiting asset growth as conditions improve. In contrast, exploratory learning strategies---leveraging risk-free juvenile exploration and peer influence---foster risk-tolerant attitudes that thrive in affluent, low-risk settings where wealth buffers and social safety nets reduce the costs of miscalculations. Introducing economic stratification to the model reveals how wealth disparities and inter-class interactions reinforce these patterns, exacerbating differences in learning strategies and risk-taking behaviors, and perpetuating socioeconomic inequalities through the cultural inertia of excessive risk aversion. By uniting developmental, social, and evolutionary perspectives, our framework provides a novel lens on the cultural evolution of risk attitudes and their broader societal implications.",

        "abstract": "To protect users' online privacy, many Internet browsers prohibit advertisers from tracking user information or targeting potential consumers. Advertisers are concerned that such retargeting prohibition policies could lead to a reduction in ads' click probability, thereby affecting their bidding valuations. Bid data from a demand-side platform (DSP) reveals that the bid valuations for non-retargeted impressions are more than 60% lower than those for retargeted ones. However, since the retargeting status is only observed for bids winning the internal auction at the DSP, we need to correct the selection bias. To address this, we develop an internal auction model and structurally estimate the advertisers' CPC and CTR. Counterfactual simulations using the estimate indicate the expected bid reduces by 38.10% on average if retargeting is prohibited compared to the scenario with the industry-average retargeting prevalence.",

        "abstract": "In certain settings, goods can be consumed outside of formal markets (e.g.: theft, counterfeit, or illegal sharing of subscriptions). When the share of informality is large, firms’ pricing decisions can be substantially affected, as the extensive margin - customers migrating to informal consumption - makes demand more elastic. We study this question in the context of electricity theft in Brazil, where stolen energy can represent more than 50% of the total formal market. We use detailed micro data from a major electric utility to estimate a structural model where consumers choose if they want to be formal or informal and then, how much to consume. For identification, we leverage a natural experiment where prices increased permanently to a set of consumers. We use the model to simulate counterfactual scenarios where: (i) theft is not possible, and (ii) the firm uses different pricing strategies. We find that the presence of informality increases the elasticity of demand from 0.24 to 0.39, and reduces monopoly optimal prices by 10.4%. Eliminating theft altogether would allow the firm to reduce prices by 17.7% while keeping profits constant. We also find that price discrimination is an effective tool to reduce informality rates.",

What would happen to someone exposed simultaneously to both types of shocks? I tackle this question in the context of Vietnam, where a universal primary education reform (a positive shock) and an introduction of tuition fee for secondary education (a negative shock) took place almost at the same time but affected different cohorts. I find that the negative shock decreased individual years of schooling, whereas the positive shock increased it. The beneficial effect of the positive shock outstrips the adverse effect of the negative shock, resulting in an overall improvement in educational attainment for those exposed to both shocks. The favorable joint effect on schooling is more pronounced for socioeconomically disadvantaged rural residents, women, and ethnic minorities. Educational assortative mating, intergenerational persistence of education, and labor market outcomes are also examined in this article.",

It examines professionalism through sociological frameworks, aligning the National Decision Model (NDM) used in police training with academic models such as Burch’s Learning Stages of Competence and Leicester’s Four Habits of Thought. The paper argues that embedding critical thinking within public order training enhances ethical decision making, problem solving, and adaptability, thereby reinforcing professional standards. It also considers the impact of recent changes in police entry routes, including a non degree pathway, on the ongoing professionalisation of the police service. Ultimately, the integration of critical thinking into training is deemed essential for advancing UK policing's professionalisation.",

        "abstract": "Authors from low- and middle-income countries often have lower acceptance rates in academic journals, leading to their ideas receiving less attention. One factor hypothesized to affect acceptance rates is the limited geographical diversity of peer reviewers. If reviewers favor submissions from their own country and authors from certain countries are disproportionately reviewed by same-country reviewers, this creates a “geographical representation bias.” Using administrative data from the Institute of Physics Publishing (IOP), encompassing metadata on 204,718 submissions to 60 English-language journals from January 2018 to December 2022, we find evidence of this bias even after controlling for manuscript quality. An exploratory analysis exploiting a policy that resulted in quasi-random anonymization of some submissions shows that hiding authors’ identities does not significantly reduce country-level homophily. The findings support the need for sustained efforts at diversifying reviewer pools.",

        "abstract": "The comparative analysis of Ecuadorian and Cuban migrants’ recent experiences of return to their respective countries of origin, notably from Spain and other European countries affected by the global financial crisis, highlights significant convergences in the areas of everyday life that become key sources of moral concern and deliberation. Among these are the economic activities and relations that migrants develop upon returning, which are heavily invested by moral reasoning and critique. The economic life of returnees garners much attention among local residents, who focus on it to assess the transformative potential of migration and to appraise migrants’ reincorporation of, and effects on Ecuadorian and Cuban society. In turn, returnees elaborate on how their life in Europe has affected their economic subjectivities, practices, and ideals. Such assessments lead them to reevaluate the place and nature of the ‘economic’ and its relation to ‘culture’ and ‘society’. Looking at how specific moral concerns and deliberations emerge and circulate with migratory trajectories, we argue, is a productive way to uncover their transformative effects and power differentials. By focusing on why and how specific domains of life are morally teased out and charged, we gain new insights on how migratory experiences reshape people’s ways of being, their ideals of a good life, and the contexts and situations in which they become entangled.",

The determinants of GBV are complex and include many factors that are sensitive to the impacts of climate change. However, the links between climate and GBV have been understudied relative to many other social impacts of climate change. In this narrative review, we describe how climate change can shape the incidence of GBV through its effects on human physiology and psychological well-being, economic and natural resources, migration patterns, and access to critical infrastructure and services. Empirical and theoretical gaps in this body of literature are significant and stem from an over-reliance on traditional measures of domestic violence and household surveys from a non-representative set of contexts. We argue that researchers should develop new, multi-method approaches for studying GBV and its relationship to climate variability, which can allow for a more expansive understanding of climate effects on violence.",

In this study, we identify different pathways behind long-term unemployment utilising information on previous labour market position. Further, we analyse differences in health care and social benefits use based on these pathways. This study aims to produce knowledge useful for early identification and supportive actions for those outside of labour market or in risk of such. Methods Among Finnish working age population, individuals who had been mainly unemployed in years 2020 and 2021 and had information on their labour market position for years 2013-2021 were identified (n = 72,485). For the analysis, register information from Statistics Finland, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland and Finnish Institute for Welfare and Health was used. To identify diverse pathways based on previous labour market position, sequence analysis was conducted. Linear regression models were used to analyse cluster differences in health care and social benefits use while controlling for potential confounders age, sex, education, living situation, migrant background and low income. Results Five clusters were identified based on previous labour market position: unemployed (54%), students (3%), employed (23%), inactive (10%) and individuals with unstable working career (10%). Health care attendance was most frequent among those inactive and unemployed. These clusters had also highest share of those with mental and musculoskeletal disorders and were most with sickness absence and with basic social assistance. In these associations between health care and benefits use and clusters, confounding due to sociodemographic factors seems to play a minor role apart from students, with whom we saw decreased risk of mental health diagnoses compared to unemployment when confounding due to age and sex was taken into account. Income differences between clusters were large in beginning of the observation years. In the end of the observation time, unemployed, inactive and students were at similar level of income while those in employment and those returned to unemployment had higher earnings. Conclusions Previous labour market position should be considered while planning preventive efforts and developing individual multisectoral services and social security for those in risk of labour market marginalisation.",

However, connecting text to authorship could be a boon for digital demography and expand the scope of computational text analysis from trends of what is being written toward social patterning of the people producing it. We explore this potential through examinations of a large corpus of college admissions essays (n = 254,820 essays submitted by 83,538 applicants) and show how personal identity markers and ZIP code-level social context data influence large scale processes of textual production. After generating numerical representations of the essays using computational methods, we model the relationships between different identity and spatial characteristics of applicants and their local communities. We find strong relationships between identity and spatial features with the essays. We also find that individuals whose personal identities are spatially unique--that is, demographically different from others in their immediate content--were most likely to be misclassified, indicating that writing is influenced both socially and spatially. This work clarifies how authorship characteristics shape large scale textual production processes, like college admissions, and complements other large scale analyses of text by focusing on authorship rather than purely textual patterns.",

        "abstract": "Despite ongoing debates on environmental justice, the link between selective residential migration and the unequal exposure to environmental hazards remains underexplored. Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighbourhoods as immigrants -- the relevant counterfactual -- they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.",

Quality signals from cultural intermediaries significantly increase loans, especially among individuals with high levels of cultural capital. This challenges the emphasis on the detached aesthetic dispositions of the cultural elite in Bourdieu’s theory on cultural distinction. Second, higher cultural legitimacy does not increase signal impact. This questions the assumption that cultural intermediaries mobilize cultural legitimacy to consecrate cultural products.

Since concurrent mixed-mode designs usually achieve higher initial response rates at lower bias than sequential mixed-mode designs, the former may be ideal for panel recruitment. However, concurrent designs producea high share of paper respondents relative to web respondents. Since these paper respondents have been found to be at higher risk of attrition, cause higher data collection costs, and slow down the fieldwork process, sequential mixed-mode designs may be more practical in the regular course of the panel study after recruitment. Our study provides experimental evidence on the effect of switching a panel study from concurrent to sequential mixed-mode design after the panel recruitment. Results show that this switch significantly increases the share of online respondents without harming response rates. Respondents who are pushed to the web by the design change differ significantly from respondents who continue to participate via paper questionnaires with regard to a number of socio-digital inequality correlates. This suggests that, while the share of online respondents can be increased through mode sequencing, keeping the paper mail mode option is vital for ensuring continued representation od societal subgroups.",

This report aims at providing a definitional framework for this value by drawing upon the domains of philosophy, political science and psychology, examining solidarity practices, including EU responses to major current crises in the EU. This report also provides options on how solidarity can be fostered through educational policies and practices. Among other aspects of the complexity surrounding solidarity, this report discusses the levels, longitudinal variation, and relevance as a political desideratum in democratic societies. This report also examines how solidarity relates to other sociological and psychological concepts, such as social identity, altruism, and social norms. Findings indicate the need to look at intergenerational solidarity and the salience of solidarity in discussions concerning the welfare state, the economy, migration, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, to cite some current concerns that are high on public and political agendas. In education, we find that instilling the value of European solidarity, among other common values, is key for the European integration project. We therefore recommend pursuing policies to foster solidarity at all levels and, with particular reference to Education in particular, to include solidarity education in school curricula in support of the promotion of European values.",

Together, we examine how these processes amplify a certain demographic subset of experts over others in a cumulative manner and what the consequences are for the selection and representation of experts to the public, and to the legitimacy of expert authority, more generally",

        "abstract": "Background In England, the Professional Nurse Advocate (PNA) and Professional Midwifery Advocate (PMA) role places nurses and midwives at the centre of workforce retention and transformation. The PNA/PMA role blends professional nursing leadership and clinical supervision through the Advocating for Education and Quality Improvement (A-EQUIP) model, which is grounded in directing change and steering service development. Taken collectively, the overarching impetus for the PNA/PMA role is to improve quality of care whilst developing and sustaining cultures of professional wellbeing and nurse/midwife retention. To date, however, little is known about what the impact the PNA/PMA role might have on the day-to-day practice of nurses and midwives, nor if it improves quality in practice, professional wellbeing, and retention. This NHS-funded study examines the impact of the PNA/PMA role on nurse/midwife involvement in quality improvement, wellbeing, and retention within one public sector healthcare NHS Trust in England. Study design and methods During 2022, fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with PNA’s and PMA’s who had completed their training and are included on the NHS Trust PNA/PMA register. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed through qualitative thematic analysis. Results Thematic analysis detected 5 themes and 10 subthemes: (1) Transforming in Tandem (a) Role of Advocacy, (b) Restorative Focus, (2) Creating Safe Spaces, (c) Emotional Support, (d) Interpersonal Relationships, (3) Challenging the Status Quo (e) Counteracting Blame Culture, (f) Empowering Change (4) Empowerment and Development (g) Building Resilience (h) Building Resilience, (5) Types of Advocacy (i) Educational and Emotional Advocacy (j) Coaching and Conversations. Conclusions The findings suggests that the most effective aspects of the Professional Nurse Advocate (PNA) and Professional Midwife Advocate (PMA) roles are those that directly empower individuals and create a supportive, reflective environment. However, while building resilience is vital, it is equally important to recognize its limits and ensure that healthcare professionals are not pushed to the point where their resilience becomes a barrier to their well-being and the overall improvement of their work environment.",

        "abstract": "Traditional perspectives on occupational structure often emphasize hierarchical and socio-economic dimensions, typically reducing it to a one-dimensional framework. As noted in much previous research, this simplification may overlook the complexity of critical social issues. We argue that occupational structure is inherently continuous and multidimensional. Building on previous research, we anticipate that it is governed by at least two primary dimensions closely linked to socio-economic status and gender. Our study analyzes 10,219,276 connections among 95 occupations recorded in the Swedish occupational registry from 2001 to 2013. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS), we explore the patterns of individual mobility to better capture the core features of occupational structure. Our findings challenge the adequacy of simplified models and suggest a more efficient alternative to detailed contemporary approaches like the micro class model and the multiple scales derived from occupational dictionaries. The analysis reveals a three-dimensional model of occupational structure, distinguishing three status orders and providing deeper insights into the varied contributions of different occupations. We find that one dimension strongly correlates with socio-economic status, while the connection to gender division is weaker.",

This article explains how Pierre Bourdieu's inequalities in social capital fit well in interpreting citation cartels. Citations of publications that estimate the h index have resulted in the gamification of metrics, a social capital tool for acquiring economic capital for faculty entry and funding. The gamification of the h index bolts perfectly to Pierre Bourdieu's cold realities of social inequalities.

In other words, mindbody responses are highly influenced by the environmental conditions and cultural interpretations of the meaning-maker involved in the response and its midbody consequences. Individuals can be extroverted with family and introverted with strangers, emotional openness is valued in one culture and discouraged in another, collectivism vs individualist influences in cultural perception, and so on. The Centenarian Consciousness Index (CCI) is a 60 questions assessment instrument derived from over 20 years of ethnographic content analysis of healthy centenarians (100 years or older), including collectivist and individualist Eastern and Western cultures. Each question is measured with a five-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree to strongly agree.” As it relates to correlating biological longevity markers (micro-assessment) and mindbody patterns of perceiving and emoting the world (macro-assessment), the (CCI) measures 4 perceptual and 4 emotional factors common to centenarians from most cultures, expressed during favorable as well as adverse conditions, independent of cultures, capturing the unique ways they perceive and emote their inner and outer world.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) provide cost-effective but possibly inaccurate predictions of human behavior. Despite growing evidence that predicted and observed behavior are often not interchangeable, there is limited guidance on using LLMs to obtain valid estimates of causal effects and other parameters. We argue that LLM predictions should be treated as potentially informative observations, while human subjects serve as a gold standard in a mixed subjects design. This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate–and extend–prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations. We define the PPI correlation as a measure of interchangeability and derive the effective sample size for PPI. We also introduce a power analysis to optimally choose between informative but costly human subjects and less informative but cheap predictions of human behavior. Mixed subjects designs could enhance scientific productivity and reduce inequality in access to costly evidence.",

        "abstract": "The current study addresses political party trust and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principle application in Italian regions. Trust in political parties is a principal driving force in governance performance, compliance with policies, and citizen trust in institution-made choices. With political and economic diversity in its regions, Italian regions present a case study for testing whether political institution trust increased creates increased ESG use and whether ESG policies have an impact in shaping political trust in reciprocity. Empirical evidence confirms that in high political trust regions, ESG programs have a high opportunity for effective implementation, particularly in social welfare and conservation of environment. In contrast, political institution trust weakness is accompanied with poor ESG pledges, an expression of inefficient governance and reduced accountability in companies. ESG policies actually have an impact on political trust—effective and transparent ESG actions establish institution trust, but shallow and political ESG actions produce mistrust. The observations have a function of projecting the contribution towards balancing institution trust with sustainability through governance quality. Policymakers can contribute towards leveraging political stability in driving ESG integration in a manner that keeps such programs effective and credible for long-term development in regions and for democratic legitimacy.",

        "abstract": "In recent decades, South Korea experienced rapid growth and socio-legal changes promoting women’s rights and gender equality. This article explores how feminist issues have been framed and discussed in the Korean press from 1990 to 2022. We examine news articles that mention feminism (peminijeum), gender equality (seong pyeongdeung), and gender discrimination (seong chabyeol) from 54 national, regional, and online news outlets (n = 49,028) and employ a structural topic modelling to identify 17 major topics and shifts in topic trends over time and across press partisanship. When examining coverage longitudinally, our findings suggest that while feminism has gained increasing attention in the Korean press in the last three decades, the focus of the issues has changed substantially. Feminism is less discussed as issues of employment, family system, and education, but more as issues of party politics and elections, gender-friendly policies, and gender conflicts between men and women. Our results also highlight that liberal and conservative press emphasise different issues in their articles on feminism, focusing on preferable issues for their political readership. Our findings suggest a need for press discourse that can shed light on the neglected intersectional aspects of feminism, including class struggles and LGBTQ rights.",

Recent work in the spirit of computational social science returns to critical approach to operationalisation providing a fresh perspective on this important topic. In this chapter we highlight works that examines gender computationally, describing how they employ levels of feminist theory to challenge gender inequality at the micro, meso, and macro level. We argue that paying critical attention to how we infer and analyze gender is fruitfully in understanding society and the contributions of research. We also present various sources and methods to infer gender and provide examples of the application of such methods. We conclude by outlining the way forward for computational methods in how gender and intersectional inequality is studied.This is a draft.

        "abstract": "The advent of new generation language models has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to their exceptional understanding and human language generation capabilities. ChatGPT emerged as an essential model with remarkable strengths for various applications. DeepSeek has recently emerged as the latest advancement in NLP, showing great potential in pure text-generation jobs, semantic analysis, and context-dependent language modeling capabilities. The study investigates and compares the performance of DeepSeek and ChatGPT in assessing adult L2 (second language) acquisition errors applied primarily to South Asian Arabic learners. With this premise, we aim to evaluate their efficacy in detecting linguistic inaccuracies (morphology, syntax, semantics) and diagnosing cases of L1 (first language). Methods include error analysis of non-native Arabic sentences, comparative evaluation of the two models, and contrasting assessment of depth of reasoning. Results show that DeepSeek was significantly better at context-driven error detection (for instance, in detecting SOV word-order transfer), and ChatGPT presented more instructively relevant feedback. However, both needed fine-tuned prompts to bring in feedback related to semantic/pragmatic errors, such as missing articles and dialectal mismatches. Contributions include a proposal for integrating AI tools into L2 pedagogy, emphasizing contrastive drill and sociolinguistic awareness, and recommendations for training AI concerning L1-targeted error profiles. This research pushes the integration of AI into language instruction for scalable solutions for adult L2 learners while pointing at improvements needed in the models.",

        "abstract": "So-called ‘predatory’ publishing is often framed as an issue of unethical journal practices, but this perspective overlooks deeper structural problems in scholarly communication. The reliance on blacklists as a primary solution to identifying questionable journals fails to acknowledge the complexity of academic publishing and the broader systemic issues that contribute to unethical or controversial publishing practices. These include not only so-called ‘predatory’ journals but also concerns such as ‘special issue-ization’ and the rise of paper mills. Furthermore, the strategies used by emerging open-access mega-publishers increasingly resemble those employed by traditional and hybrid publishers, demonstrating that questionable practices are not confined to a single category of journals. This research in progress critically examines the characteristics of journals labeled as so-called ‘predatory’ and questions the effectiveness of static blacklists in scholarly assessment. Using a dataset of 2,755 journals from Predatory Reports, we systematically analyze their ISSN registration, subject classifications, accessibility, financial models, editorial transparency, and indexing status. While we recognize the limitations of blacklists, this dataset provides a basis for exploring broader patterns in academic publishing. Preliminary findings reveal that 24% of the journals became inaccessible after being listed, suggesting that some publishers shut down or rebrand to evade scrutiny. While ISSN registration is not mandatory, 13% of the journals in the dataset do not have one, which may indicate variations in registration practices. The geographical distribution of these journals is concentrated in India (31.45%), Switzerland (30.17%), and the United States (21.36%). This distribution highlights the global nature of these practices, spanning a range of publication models. The study also finds that 71% of these journals charge Article Processing Charges (APCs), while 23.7% fail to disclose APCs before submission, creating financial uncertainty for authors. Rather than indiscriminately covering all fields, many journals now focus on STEM disciplines. These findings underscore the need for more nuanced, criteria-based evaluation frameworks that account for the complexities of scholarly publishing, moving beyond binary categorizations of journals as ‘predatory’ or legitimate.",

        "abstract": "The Sulu Archipelago, nestled between Mindanao and Borneo, has been a melting pot of people and cultures for thousands of years. Major sociopolitical changes marked its history, attracting groups of people or forcing drastic dispersals. Today, the islands host various ethnolinguistic groups, including Sama-Badjaw and Tausug-speaking communities. We surveyed the literature from multiple disciplines—linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, history, and genetics—to shed light on past movements and the emergence of ethnicities in the region. Three factors drive ethnogenesis in the Sulu Archipelago: niche or economic specialisation, social hierarchies, and assimilation. Economic specialisation initially fostered differentiation among groups inhabiting reef and island ecosystems. The most extreme adaptive strategy was boat-nomadism, whose origin was tied to the evolving sociopolitical order. With the rise of the Sultanate of Sulu, differences in rank and religion were articulated along ethnic lines. The Tausug assumed formal dominance over the surrounding populace, whereas the Sama Dilaut were relegated to society’s periphery. The mid-eighteenth century saw the integration of Sulu within the global trading network which created a labour-driven economy focused on procuring local products. During this period, the Sama Bangingi emerged as specialised maritime raiders who incorporated captive peoples from parts of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Following the end of foreign imperial control, the peoples of Sulu found themselves subsumed within the modern Philippine state. Social change continues as the Sama Dilaut integrate into the broader Sama milieu, and the rest of the Sulu Archipelago into Filipino society.",

        "authors": "Marianne Hem Eriksen, Brian Costello",
        "created": "2025-02-01",
        "abstract": "The drunk and frenzied Viking is a trope in line with associated stereotypes of blood-thirsty warriors and senseless violence. However, enough evidence remains to suggest that intoxication due to alcohol, and perhaps other psychoactive substances, was integral to many aspects of life in the Late Iron/Viking Ages. After all, apparently there is no other word for ‘sober’ in Old Norse than ódrukkin — ‘un-drunk’. Viking bodies were, in many ways, bodies of intoxication. One of the aspects of life that alcohol permeates is ritual practice. To the extent that this has been studied, the use of alcohol conventionally links to ideas of frenzied warriors and berserkers, or with feasting. Some research over the last few decades has related intoxicants to ritual practices, specifically that of the völva — the female ritual specialist (e.g. Price 2019). More broadly Germanic work has centered élite drinking culture and the role of the ‘lady with the mead-cup’ (Enright 1996) and the female leader of the household as a powerbroker, mediating power relationships within the warrior-band through pouring of alcohol. What Iron and Viking age studies have not contemplated in much detail so far, is the fundamentally material and embodied process of making and ingesting alcohol or other psychoactives by taking them into and incorporating them with the body, generating specific embodied reactions in specific settings. Drawing on seminal work in anthropology and philosophy, this paper centers alcohol as a form of material culture, providing tangible sets of sensory experiences, but ultimately destined to be destroyed through the process of ingestion.",

        "abstract": "Growing global concern about the problems associated with concentrated market power in the digital economy is leading to a renewed interest in competition policy. Since the late 2010s, China’s government has squarely confronted the problems of its own ‘Big Tech’ with a new competition regime for digital markets. Outcomes represent a unique learning opportunity for Western academics, competition authorities and lawmakers alike, which has so far been underutilized. However, given unreliable official figures, a new methodology is needed to assess competition in China’s digital economy. This article introduces a market capitalization approach that builds on the informativeness of China’s financial markets. We use Bloomberg financial data of 1142 publicly listed firms for the period 2019 to 2022 to quantitatively examine the impact of China’s new digital competition regime. We find a causal link between the new governance approach and a reduction of market concentration and aggregate growth in the primary markets of China’s three most dominant digital platforms – Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BATs). Further, our results show a robust correlation between the new competition regime and reduced market concentration and market capitalization growth rates across China’s digital markets. Other empirical findings include a negative correlation between market concentration and the openness of digital markets, a non-relationship between market concentration and profits, and the inability of profit and revenue-based metrics to capture market power effectively in China’s digital economy. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these insights for Western regulatory strategies, particularly as the EU and China emerge as global frontrunners in the field of digital competition regulation.",
