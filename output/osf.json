        "abstract": "As climate impacts intensify, governments increasingly adopt adaptation policies, yet their electoral consequences remain poorly understood. We study electoral effects of moratoria on homeowners insurance nonrenewals after California wildfires. Using a difference-in-differences design exploiting eligibility rules, we find null effects on support for incumbents. To explain, we develop a framework of experience-based accountability, arguing that the electoral effect of adaptation is path-dependent: prior crisis experience sets the standard for what voters perceive as a sufficient policy. Consistent with this, we find modest electoral rewards where prior insurance disruption was limited, but none where it was chronic. Survey evidence indicates that, prior to the policy, residents of high-disruption areas already held more negative and crystallized views of the governor. We offer a framework for the politics of adaptation, showing that credit depends on perceived sufficiency: a standard set not only by the policy, but also by voters’ prior experience with the crisis.",

        "abstract": "Social media platforms play an increasingly important role in political campaigning, enabling parties to bypass traditional media and mobilize support directly. While prior research highlights the online prominence of far-right and radical populist actors, most studies are limited to single platforms or national contexts. This study presents the first cross- platform and cross-national analysis of digital campaign communication by 401 parties across all 27 EU member states during the 2024 Euro- pean Parliament election. Using data from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, and YouTube, we examine party activity and audience engage- ment. By linking digital trace data with expert surveys, we test whether populist radical right parties disproportionately succeed in raising engage- ment online. Our findings confirm strong platform-specific advantages of radical populist parties, particularly on TikTok, YouTube and Facebook. We also observe high engagement for far-left populist parties with similar emotional and anti-elitist communication strategies. The more Eurosceptic positions a party holds, or the more frequently experts describe them to use emotional appeals or anti-elitist communication, the more audience engagement they received across several platforms. Overall the findings emphasize a disproportionate online support for radical populist parties across the European Union.",

        "authors": "Alen Kaminski",
        "created": "2025-11-22",
        "abstract": "The comparative analysis of authoritarian regimes has traditionally oscillated between the Scylla of \"great man\" theories, which reduce macro-historical patterns to biographical contingency, and the Charybdis of structural determinism, which often obscures the distinct character of specific regimes behind statistical aggregates. While contemporary structural-demographic models excel at forecasting the temporal onset of systemic crises, they remain largely silent on the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the specific morphology of the successor regime. This article addresses this predictive gap by proposing the Ideological Correspondence Hypothesis. Building upon the Anatomy of Chaos theoretical framework, we posit that the operational strategy of a regime is structurally determined by the epistemological architecture of its dominant ideology. We argue that regimes grounded in materialist-rationalist epistemologies instinctively prioritize Structural Resilience Engineering (SRI), creating systems that are institutionally robust yet brittle in the face of legitimacy deficits. Conversely, regimes grounded in irrationalist-mythic epistemologies prioritize Archetypal Mobilization (AAI), generating intense charismatic loyalty but structural vulnerability to elite fragmentation. Through a comparative analysis of paradigmatic historical cases—contrasting the survival of the Stalinist bureaucracy against the collapse of the Nazi charismatic state, and examining the internal epistemological shift from Maoist voluntarism to Dengist pragmatism—we demonstrate that a regime’s underlying theory of knowledge serves as a robust predictor of its strategic behavior and post-crisis trajectory. Finally, we extend this hypothesis to contemporary geopolitical analysis, offering falsifiable forecasts for the trajectories of current theocratic and neo-authoritarian regimes, suggesting that the study of ideology must move beyond descriptive sociology to become a central component of predictive political science.",

We map over 500 LAs involved in climate-related R&amp;I projects and nearly 14,000 LAs participating in 12 TMNs. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used to identify influential hubs, LAs that have potential to both generate and spread adaptation knowledge. We find considerable variation in participation across LAs, both in R&amp;I projects and TMN membership.

        "abstract": "The Rights of Nature (RoN) movement is often celebrated as a promising rupture from anthropocentric and extractive legal norms. Yet much RoN discourse assumes that rights are inherently emancipatory. This article challenges that assumption by tracing the long and paradoxical history of rights as epistemic technologies that both consolidate and contest power. Rights emerged alongside enclosure and colonization, long defining who counts as a legal subject. At the same time, they have been strategically reclaimed by the subjugated and marginalized in moments of rupture as instruments of survival and material advancement. Beginning with divergent case studies from Ecuador, the United States, and Aotearoa New Zealand, this paper places these RoN efforts in dialogue with critical histories and contemporary debates around rights. Rather than asking whether nature can hold rights, it interrogates whether rights themselves can reasonably engender liberatory multi-species politics without reinscribing the very legal orders they aim to transcend.",

        "abstract": "Since COVID-19, governments have accelerated efforts to replace civil servants with AI. This article argues that this rapid substitution risks undermining a core commitment of democratic administration: accountable, reason-giving bureaucratic discretion. Drawing on cases of automated eligibility, sanctioning, and standardization, it shows that algorithmic tools govern through statistical regularities, which can obscure responsibility, mishandle atypical cases, and weaken citizens’ claims to individualized consideration. Building on classic public administration debates and newer work on system-level bureaucracy, the article reframes AI adoption as a constitutional, not merely technical, question: which administrative decisions may be standardized, and which must remain under human control because they implicate fairness, equity, or rights? The article concludes with a selective ``centaur’’ model in which AI supports but does not displace human officials, preserving explanation, accountability, and appeal.",

        "abstract": "This study estimates the near-term risk of renewed Israel–Iran escalation using a modular, multi-model framework that converts expert judgments and open-source indicators into probabilistic scenarios over a 90-day horizon. We elicit LOW–CENTRAL–HIGH priors from domain experts across 18 indicators spanning air/missile, land, maritime, cyber, diplomacy, information, and proxy alignment (including Israeli standoff and air-strike activity), then fuse evidence via Bayesian updating and infer a weekly escalation state on a seven-rung ladder with a light stocks/flows scaffold for magazines, interceptor use, and repair/re-supply constraints. We triangulate forecasts across three complementary stacks (Bayesian state-space, statistical ensemble, and game-theoretic signalling). At the analysis cut-off (2025-10-22, UK), All three models agree that S1 (Managed Conflict) is modal, S2 (Northern War with Maritime Squeeze) is the principal alternative, and S3–S4 remain lower-probability tails. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the S1&lt;-&gt;S2 margin is most responsive to air/missile defence saturation and combined launch/strike pressure together with maritime war-risk stress, with mediation activity providing the strongest stabilising counterweight. We also formalise tail-risk triggers for potential state fracture and specify how crossing them would reweight S4. The result is a transparent, updateable, and non-partisan forecast designed for decision support: it communicates where risk mass sits, what could move it, and which levers plausibly bend trajectories while avoiding operationally sensitive detail.",

Fifty instruments across eleven themes were endorsed by a majority of respondents as ones that should be part of an EU sustainability policy mix aiming for reduced ecological footprints, securing well-being, and increasing equity. Nine policy instruments stood out for their high perceived potential, feasibility, and independence from economic growth: phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, greening credit regulations, North-South technology transfer, carbon consumption taxes, long-term warranties, repair infrastructure, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, ecological education, and environmental justice-focused education. Perceptions of higher policy potential were closely associated with greater perceived feasibility and a degrowth orientation in respondents’ own work. The findings suggest that many post-growth policies are viewed as realistic and legitimate options for the EU.",

        "abstract": "Voter opposition to new housing development contributes to America's housing shortage. Prevailing explanations for voter opposition emphasize homeowner self-interest and ``NIMBY'' concerns with new housing's local negative externalities. We argue that sociotropic aesthetic judgments also powerfully shape housing policy preferences, helping explain significant patterns of opposition to housing development. We support this argument with a variety of novel descriptive and experimental findings. Motivating our analysis, we first show that homeowners in already-dense areas are highly supportive of new apartments in their neighborhoods---indeed, moreso than in neighborhoods of single-family homes---a pattern prevailing theories cannot easily explain. We then show that measures of aesthetic tastes strongly predict support for dense housing development, as do experimental manipulations which vary the aesthetic quality of new housing---even for housing located far away from the respondent's neighborhood. Other explanations offer more limited explanatory power. Finally, we show how crafting housing policies to be sensitive to voters' aesthetic judgments could help address America's housing shortage.",

        "abstract": "Political polarization in America has intensified beyond mere disagreement to what scholars characterize as sectarianism – a condition where partisan identity fundamentally shapes moral judgments. A key marker of sectarianism is asymmetric moral standards for violence, where aggression against political opponents is considered more justified than identical violence targeting one's own group. Using a survey experiment featuring a realistic political rally scenario, we find compelling evidence in support of such sectarianism: partisan bias in the US extends to evaluations of political violence. By manipulating the partisan affiliations of perpetrators and targets, as well as provocation severity, we find that both Democrats and Republicans exhibit substantial and symmetrical partisan bias. This double standard is particularly pronounced among strong partisans, who are nearly three times more likely to justify violence against the opposition than violence targeting their own party. These results extend sectarianism theory beyond policy preferences to physical violence, suggesting partisan identity now functions as a powerful perceptual filter that can legitimize political aggression when directed at opponents.",

        "abstract": "Growing citizen dissatisfaction with current governance raises the question of what future governance systems should look like. We conducted a large survey experiment in the United States and Germany, with 5,000 respondents each, to explore how citizens would design their ideal governance system. We focus on two scenarios: a utopian Mars setting, in which citizens were asked to design governance from scratch, and an Earth setting, in which citizens were asked to redesign the existing governance system they live in. On the basis of a constant sum and conjoint analysis, we find a strong preference for mixed and “multicameral” (McKay, 2025) governance models that distribute decision-making among multiple actors. In the Mars scenario, citizens slightly “de-center” the representative model in favor of a greater emphasis on participatory and expertocratic components. There is also an even more pronounced preference for strong oversight. Our findings suggest that citizens' ideal governance preferences differ greatly from the current institutional status quo in both countries. Despite current authoritarian trends, citizens favor a system of governance based on institutional cooperation and robust checks and balances.",

        "abstract": "What shapes citizens’ willingness to mobilize against the far right? While research on far-right party support has expanded rapidly, we know less about when democratic publics mobilize to oppose these actors. This paper examines how elite framing influences anti-far-right activism, drawing on Germany’s 2024 mass protests against the AfD and the ambivalent response from conservative (CDU/CSU) elites. A pre-registered survey experiment (N = 3,310) tests the effects of positive and negative protest frames—both with and without attribution to conservative politicians— on protest intention, petition interest, and donation behavior. Negative frames linking protests to Antifa significantly reduce mobilization, while positive frames emphasizing the defense of liberal democracy do not increase participation overall but can mobilize conservative voters who endorse the party’s “firewall” against the AfD. Overall, this study shows that delegitimizing rhetoric demobilizes citizens, revealing how elite discourse can erode grassroots democratic resilience.",

More often than not, these networks link, directly or indirectly, to other levels and actors of governance, thus generating peculiar configurations of multilevel governance (MLG). This paper connects TCNs to the MLG conceptual framework by locating the former within an institutional space defined by the two types of MLG formulated by Hooghe and Marks, and reflecting on some of the implications of TCNs’ position in this space. In doing so, the paper achieves two objectives: first, it opens up the dominant MLG typology to accommodate intermediate and hybrid configurations of multilevel governance. Second, based on this reconceptualization, it provides an analytical basis on which to build in subsequent empirical work on city networks.",

Drawing on literature, we critically examine these connections across three perspectives: understanding, detecting, and mitigating social bias. First, we provide a foundation for understanding how social bias shapes both CSS as a research field and its methodology. Second, we highlight how social bias can be detected not only within the CSS methodology itself but also through CSS applied to broader societal domains. Finally, moving forward, we propose strategies to mitigate social bias in the CSS methodology and CSS as a research field.

This white paper presents a governance-focused approach to scenario planning as a strategic tool for boards of directors to anticipate and navigate disruptive technological changes. We outline a six-stage Adaptive Tech Scenario Governance Cycle that integrates scenario planning into board oversight processes, ensuring organizations remain resilient and proactive amid uncertainty. The proposed approach bridges academic foresight techniques and practical board governance needs, providing clear guidance on conducting annual technology disruption scenario workshops and embedding their outcomes into corporate strategy and risk management. Scenario case studies – covering artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and climate-tech disruptions – illustrate how boards can use scenario planning to uncover emerging risks and opportunities. Finally, the paper offers implementation templates and checklists to operationalize this approach, along with a discussion of limitations and future directions. The goal is to equip governance practitioners with a concrete, repeatable method to enhance strategic foresight and organizational preparedness for the next wave of tech disruption",

        "abstract": "Weather forecasts provide substantial economic value for society, but differences in forecast accuracy across regions can potentially exacerbate existing---and create new---economic inequalities. These differences are particularly important given the role of weather forecasts in helping prevent damage from future climate change. In this paper, we provide a global analysis of the accuracy of numerical weather predictions of temperature and relate our findings to existing economic inequalities. We report two stylized facts: First, temperature forecasts are much more accurate in high-income countries compared to low-income countries. A seven-day-ahead forecast in a high-income country is, on average, more accurate than a one-day-ahead forecast in a low-income country. Second, while forecast accuracy has improved steadily since 1985, a persistent gap remains between high and low-income countries. These disparities result from both differences in the inherent scientific challenge of weather predictability across regions and from unequal weather observing infrastructure. Poorer countries have fewer land-based weather stations and radiosondes as well as lower reporting rates from existing infrastructure. Low-income countries also appear to have lower institutional capacity to issue official, local weather forecasts. Remedying the differences in monitoring infrastructure could help reduce the gap in forecast accuracy between rich and poor countries.",

        "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are standard tools for modeling social and physical phenomena from the ground up by building detailed simulations in which individual agents interact and study emergent behavior. However, since they are simulations, it is challenging to generalize or even quantitatively interpret the results. A frequent output of an ABM model is a grid with points of one or more classes that represent the agents’ configuration over time. A canonical example is the Schelling segregation model, where agents of two types follow a simple relocation rule based on their tolerance to the proportion of different agents in a given location, resulting in a segregated configuration that is visually revealing but not quantitative. In this work, we propose assigning a quantitative measure of entropy, based on the spatial configuration of the steady state of the Schelling model, to a range of population values in the model using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) techniques. The resulting dataset of quantitative metrics related to the original configuration is analyzed via Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) methods to obtain a representation of the system dynamics in the form of an ordinary differential equation.",

        "abstract": "This conceptual paper develops an integrated framework for understanding how multi-dimensional project complexity management capabilities mediate competitive dynamics in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) industries. Drawing on systematized narrative review of literature from 2020 to 2025, combined with foundational complexity theory, two complementary models are constructed: an ascending pathway depicting how emerging contractors systematically build technical, organizational, and environmental capabilities to achieve global EPC leadership; and a descending pathway characterizing how established leaders experience capability erosion when organizational and environmental complexity management capabilities deteriorate faster than technical knowledge persists. The core theoretical contribution demonstrates that sustainable EPC competitive advantage increasingly derives from the ability to simultaneously manage high technical, organizational, and environmental complexity, rather than technical knowledge alone. This insight is operationalized through a Technical-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) complexity framework, mapping how capability phases correspond to distinct complexity profiles and identifying critical junctures where strategic intervention can alter trajectory. The framework is applied diagnostically to the German Large Industrial Plant Manufacturing Industry (GLIPMI), identifying distinct subsectors in different phases of capability erosion and specifying sector-specific vulnerabilities and intervention points. Eight testable propositions are formulated connecting complexity management capabilities to competitive outcomes. The paper provides both theoretical grounding for capability-based competition in EPC markets and practical implications for firms, industry associations, and policymakers. However, it needs to be acknowledged that this framework represents theory-building rather than empirical validation; the propositions require future primary research to test causal mechanisms and boundary conditions. The analysis suggests that complexity management capability is necessary for sustained EPC leadership but may not be sufficient when confronted with asymmetric subsidization, pricing pressures, or structural financing disadvantages.",

As Indigenous (Yurok/Hoopa) and non-Indigenous co-authors, we draw on historical analysis, forest science, Yurok oral tradition, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to demonstrate how IndCE repairs the ecological and cultural harm of capitalist economies by weaving together forest health with human health. Through a case study of the Yurok Tribe in Northern California, we highlight how IndCE is not just a cultural or local economic alternative. It is a paradigm shift away from economic perspectives that ignore culture, history, land, and non-human &amp; human relationships. The Yurok stewardship practices that support its IndCE (e.g. Good Fire) provide a slew of benefits: wildfire risk mitigation, ecosystem restoration, economic revitalization, and cultural resilience. The Yurok case reveals the urgency of legitimizing and resourcing Indigenous-led ecological governance. We identify persistent policy and funding barriers that undermine this work and offer concrete paths forward to support it. This paper contributes to broader debates on sustainable economics, Indigenous rights, and community-led conservation. It also raises critical questions for non-Indigenous communities about how some state systems may sometimes obstruct, rather than support, regenerative land stewardship, cultural continuity, and ecological care. The Yurok model shows that another type of economy is not only possible; it already exists.",

The approach is methodological and focuses on the comprehensive analysis of a case study related to freight exit processes with the aim of defining and implementing a software application to support the short-term management of picking and loading operations for product delivery. The developed decision support system integrates past data series analysis and projections, time series simulations, What-If analysis capabilities, and real-time monitoring within a single computational paradigm to anticipate peak points in the freight exit process. The developed decision support system is designed to accumulate and structure operational data from the warehouse management system software, to analyse the periodic rhythms of orders received to generate graphical projections of expected peak points and working hours based on the analysis of past data series and is able to dynamically review projections via real-time monitoring capabilities to adapt projections to actual progress made at any given time. Additionally, What-If analytics capabilities facilitate management's use of various workforce combinations to determine the feasibility of the process at any time, while identifying potential bottlenecks before they occur. Test results conducted with the corporate team indicate improvements in workload visibility and readiness for associated short-term programming strategies, while preventing operational disruptions through advance alerts on operational overload points",

        "abstract": "Forthcoming, Sociological Science Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.",

This study introduces the concept of Withdrawn Advantage, describing how advantaged parents reduce their own educational inputs when they perceive school quality as high. I examine this mechanism using class size as a salient signal of school quality. Using TIMSS-2015 data and exploiting maximum class size regulations across six European countries, I implement a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to identify the effect of class size. I find that only highly educated parents reduce their engagement in children’s homework when classes are smaller, while less educated parents make no change. This occurs without any change in students’ achievement, teachers’ likelihood of assigning homework, or how frequently the child does homework. These findings suggest that equalizing effects of schools may partly reflect parental responses rather than purely in-school mechanisms.",

Prior decomposition studies have focused on employment duration or cross-sectional indicators, neglecting the timing, sequencing, and complexity of both work and family life courses, and assumed common support across gender. Using German Socio-Economic Panel data, we study West Germans aged 50–59 with an innovative two-step approach addressing these shortcomings. First, life-course feature selection identifies key wealth predictors, such as education and unemployment experiences, but also family life-course characteristics and homemaking. Second, we apply the Ñopo decomposition to quantify their contribution to the gender wealth gap. Results show that family-related factors, including homemaking, and the sequencing and timing of life-course transitions decisively shape women’s lower wealth. Gender-exclusive experiences, for which there is no counterfactual, account for much of the gap, underscoring how entrenched life-course inequalities translate into lasting economic disadvantage for women.",

        "abstract": "Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common and linked to relationship difficulties. It may affect the likelihood and timing of parenthood, yet its implications for fertility remain unclear. Methods Using Finnish population registers, we followed 759,430 individuals born in 1982–1993 to examine how ADHD is associated with the likelihood and timing of a first birth among young adults. ADHD diagnoses were identified from healthcare and prescription records. Discrete-time event-history models were estimated separately for women and men. Interaction analyses assessed whether a partner’s ADHD modified associations. Results In age- and cohort-adjusted models, ADHD was linked to lower odds of a first birth (men OR 0.92; women OR 0.90), but after adjusting for partnerships the association was reversed (men OR 1.07; women OR 1.09). At ages 18–23, ADHD was associated with a higher likelihood of having a first birth, whereas an opposite association was observed at ages at 24–30 and 31–38. Thus, ADHD was related to a higher likelihood of first birth at young ages and lower likelihood at older ages. Both partners having ADHD does not seem to intensify the association. Conclusions ADHD is associated with earlier entry into parenthood but a lower risk of first birth at later ages. The results highlight the importance of accounting for partnerships: before this adjustment, ADHD was negatively related to the likelihood of becoming a parent, whereas after adjusting for partnerships the association reversed. This underscores partnership formation as a key pathway and suggests that supporting stable unions may help mitigate ADHD-related disparities in first births.

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of internet technologies has substantially transformed sexual socialization among Indian youth, with digital platforms providing unprecedented access to pornography. This study investigates patterns of pornography consumption, perceptions toward it, the influence on sexual and gender identity, and associated psychosocial impacts among 100 youth respondents, primarily college students aged 18 to 30, across diverse backgrounds. Findings reveal that 13% of participants use pornography daily, demonstrating significant frequent engagement, while a majority also access it with varying less frequent patterns. Early exposure during adolescence is common, with 59% reporting first exposure before age 18. Smartphones (75%) and websites (74%) dominate access. Youth demonstrate divided moral perspectives, with 31% viewing pornography as morally wrong and an equal proportion (31%) considering it normal or acceptable. Guilt or anxiety is prevalent, reported by 65%. Approximately 29% report negative effects on self-esteem, body image, and sexual confidence, with 30% indicating functional impairments in education, work, or time management. The effects of pornography on sexual identity differ; 60–70% indicate no alteration in gender or identity confidence, while 20–28% report an expanded understanding or exploration, and some express confusion or diminished confidence. Gender differences emerge clearly: males tend to consume pornography more frequently and predominantly prefer heterosexual content, while females and non-binary youth display more diverse consumption patterns and greater variability in content preferences. The study highlights a critical moral-behavior disconnect and points out that it requires comprehensive sex education, destigmatization, and mental health support tailored to digital sexualities. These insights contribute to the sociological discourse on youth and sexuality in India, offering empirical evidence to inform policy, educational practice, and future research directions.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and timely estimates of migrant population stocks, disaggregated by age and sex, are critical for population projections and for understanding migration dynamics. This study proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model that extends previous work by incorporating age and sex disaggregation, using data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and digital traces from the Facebook Advertising Platform. A Bayesian multinomial–Dirichlet–Dirichlet model harmonizes age and sex profiles from the two sources, leveraging the Rogers–Castro framework to characterize migration age schedules and utilizing the conjugate nature of Dirichlet priors to ensure computational efficiency. We illustrate the framework using data on migrant populations in the United Kingdom for 2018 and 2019, based on the two sources: the Labour Force Survey and Facebook. The analysis identifies three distinct migrant groups with differing age and sex profiles: younger Western and Southern European migrants, slightly older Central and Eastern Europeans, and a predominantly older Irish migrant population. Facebook data enhances the coverage of younger migrants, who are often underrepresented in traditional surveys, while the LFS provides broader demographic context and helps benchmark the estimates to standard population definitions. The findings highlight the utility of integrating traditional and digital data sources to address gaps in migration statistics. This framework enables more accurate disaggregation of migrant population stock data and offers a scalable, computationally efficient methodology for improving migration estimates, particularly in contexts lacking ground-truth data. The approach also yields insights into migration patterns and demographic structures, with potential applications in policy planning and demographic research.",

        "abstract": "AI adoption varies systematically across generations, with differential exposure to technology shaping patterns of engagement, reliance, and risk. I propose that generational priming skews the anthropomorphism baseline, producing cohort-specific tendencies in adoption and vulnerability. Older adults, shaped by the scarcity and novelty of early digital systems, anthropomorphize minimally and face risks tied to misunderstanding and misinformation. Bridge cohorts, transitioning from analog to digital, exhibit situational anthropomorphism and mixed vulnerabilities. Younger generations, immersed in digital environments from birth, often default to relational engagement with AI, raising identity-level concerns such as coherence erosion, dependency, and epistemic drift. While most existing evidence is cross-sectional or short-term, converging findings from developmental, design, and clinical studies suggest stronger emotional engagement, blurred human/AI boundaries, and heightened sensitivity to linguistic and interface cues among youth. Policy, regulation, and design can leverage these generational differences through measures such as transparent AI disclosures in youth-facing platforms, funding longitudinal studies that track identity development under AI exposure, and creating interdisciplinary advisory panels that bridge HCI, developmental psychology, and clinical research.",

We propose a new probabilistic approach for identifying fertility transition stalls based on the results of the 2024 revision of World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2024a) and apply it to all countries for periods when total fertility is above 2.1 live births per woman. Our method is not restricted to inter-survey intervals; it uses all available data from all available data sources, incorporates biases and measurement errors, and provides probabilistic estimates of fertility stalls. We compared our findings for sub-Saharan Africa to those in the literature and found that the probability of many previously identified stalls is quite low based on the data available. We also identify several stalls (or reversals) in fertility decline across all regions since 1950 and discuss potential reasons for these changes in fertility trends.",

This analysis calculated U.S. trends in the number of individuals who lost a close kin, such as a mother, father, at least one sibling, or at least one child, and how the number of bereaved people changes under counterfactual mortality conditions. We found that adverse mortality in 2010–2019 and spikes in mortality in 2020–2021 resulted in a substantial increase in the number of individuals bereaved annually. Increases over time were especially large for individuals bereaved by sibling loss. If the United States had maintained its rates of mortality improvement from 2000–2009, about 2.7 million fewer people would have experienced at least one close-kin loss during 2010–2019. By 2021, the excess number of individuals who had ever been bereaved since 2010 had grown to 5.6 million. Considering single years, in 2019 alone 8.6% of all bereaved individuals—around 0.9 million people—would not have lost any close relative had the United States maintained its previous pace of mortality improvement. In 2021, the corresponding annual excess rose to 25%, or about 3.2 million individuals. Excess bereavement is similar when applying the concurrent rates of mortality improvement of countries like Japan and Switzerland. Decomposition analyses revealed that excess bereavement in the United States can be explained primarily by adverse mortality trends, rather than by differences in size or composition of the population at risk. Considering population health trends from the perspective of the number bereaved shifts the focus from individual deaths to their rippling effects on surviving family, at a population scale.",

The analysis spanned bilateral, multilateral, distributive, integrative, crisis, and communication-constrained scenarios, revealing a “context paradox”: models effective in one setting often faltered in another. Spiritually inspired approaches excelled in emotionally complex and relational contexts, while tactically optimized models thrived in structured, goal-driven situations. Under language barriers, models emphasizing authenticity and emotional intelligence showed greater adaptability, highlighting communication resilience as a key negotiation capability. Conversely, contemporary approaches proved particularly effective in maximizing quantifiable outcomes and sustaining strategic coherence under competing priorities. These findings challenge the outcome-centric orientation of mainstream negotiation research and support a pluralistic, context-sensitive understanding of negotiation effectiveness, showing that contextual variation fundamentally shapes negotiation practice.",

        "abstract": "El intercambio de favores es una de las manifestaciones más habituales de altruismo social, y una dinámica común en las relaciones humanas. Implica una transferencia de valor que no se suele hacer explícita, lo que puede conducir a valoraciones perceptivas discrepantes por parte de dador y receptor del favor. Los intentos de analizar formalmente estas dinámicas se ven dificultados por la naturaleza subjetiva y no expresada de las expectativas de valor y deuda que se generan, y por la condición no siempre monetaria de estos actos. Este articulo introduce la propuesta teórica de un nuevo marco de análisis conceptual, la Matriz de Valoración Subjetiva (MVS), basado en una representación geométrica-espacial diseñada para hacer visibles estas dinámicas. La MVS construye la valoración de un favor a partir de dos dimensiones fundamentales: el sacrificio que supone para el dador y el beneficio que reporta al receptor. Sobre esta base, el modelo va incorporando la formalización de los sesgos perceptivos conocidos, logrando mostrar una representación del espacio subjetivo distorsionado de valoración de cada actor. Mediante la superposición de ambas representaciones, dador y receptor, se consigue hacer visible la distancia perceptiva entre ambos, e identificar las áreas del espacio valorativo donde el conflicto latente es más probable. La MVS ofrece una herramienta para visualizar el efecto de estos sesgos perceptivos, y proporciona un método analítico con potencial cuantificador que permite identificar las causas precursoras del conflicto en el ámbito del intercambio de favores, pero con capacidad de extensión a cualquier otra dinámica de intercambio de valor no explícito.",

        "abstract": "The growing use of digital tools in social research has revealed a fundamental tension: while artificial intelligence operates through opaque algorithms and variables that researchers cannot control, sociology requires transparent, reflexive, and discipline-guided processes. SOCIOKAIROS emerges as a response to this tension, proposing a completely different model: an autonomous heuristic engine, not based on AI, capable of assisting in the formulation of scientific problems through explicit sociological rules that are verifiable and controlled by the researcher. SOCIOKAIROS does not use neural networks or probabilistic statistical models. It operates fully offline with a system of Computational Epistemological Canons (CEC) that formalize classical principles of sociological object construction and convert them into heuristic rules applied to the user’s text. This logic avoids ambiguities, clarifies causal mechanisms, selects the appropriate analytical level, and identifies empirically viable indicators without delegating epistemology to external algorithms. Validated across five universities in Spain, Cuba, and Brazil (W = 0.81–0.84), SOCIOKAIROS constitutes a transparent, theoretically grounded tool for research and teaching, also integrable into Moodle through SCORM as a verifiable form of innovation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Human birth timing was historically regulated by circadian biological rhythms, with spontaneous deliveries typically occurring during the late night and early morning. However, the increasing medicalization of childbirth raises the hypothesis that social and institutional schedules now exert a dominant influence. This study empirically examines the historical transition from “biological time” to “social time” by analyzing hourly and day-of-week birth distributions among individuals born in Japan between 1960 and 1999. Using a dataset of 135,748 self-reported birth records collected from a commercial astrology web service, and after excluding default values indicating unknown times, the final analytical sample comprised 68,224 individuals. Birth trends were assessed using hour- and weekday-level aggregation, minute-level kernel density estimation, and cross-decade heatmap visualization. Results reveal a pronounced shift toward institutional scheduling. First, weekend births declined markedly, forming a clear weekend gap by the 1990s. Second, the natural dawn peak visible in the 1960s was replaced by a sharp weekday peak between 13:00 and 15:00 in the 1990s, coinciding with typical hospital operating hours; minute-level analysis confirmed that the drop at 12:00 reflects lunch-break scheduling rather than analytical artifact. Finally, heatmaps demonstrate increasing concentration of births within business hours (Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00). These findings indicate that late-20th-century Japanese birth timing increasingly reflected the logistics of medical practice rather than intrinsic physiological patterns. Beyond documenting this transition, the study demonstrates that large-scale self-reported digital data can replicate epidemiologically robust trends with high temporal resolution, suggesting potential applications in real-time public health monitoring.",

        "abstract": "This commentary proposes a renewed place-based understanding of ageing and social care research, drawing together evidence from an updated review of interventions for social isolation and insights from public engagement in contrasting urban and coastal settings. Despite a longstanding policy emphasis on ‘ageing in place’, structural conditions across England remain uneven, with rural and coastal communities often experiencing shrinking services, limited transport, digital exclusion, and fragile social infrastructures. Our updated umbrella review of 75 recent publications indicates that psychological, social, and hybrid interventions can reduce loneliness, but their impacts are inconsistent, often short-lived, and rarely examined across different geographical settings. We found no study adopted a genuinely place-based framework, leaving questions about how local environments shape both risk factors and intervention effectiveness. Insights from community engagement in London and coastal Lincolnshire further illustrate how place influences everyday experiences of ageing, highlighting shared challenges, such as fragmented services, digital barriers, and rising living costs. Whereas urban location-specific issues included isolation amid density, geographically close inequalities, and limited continuity of services, by contrast, people in coastal communities cited transport deprivation, seasonal and precarious economies and the erosion of community spaces. Taken together, these findings show that spatial inequalities are widening and that research failing to account for these, risks reinforcing them. A strengthened place-based research agenda is needed to ensure interventions are equitable, context-sensitive, and grounded in lived experience.",

Drawing on frameworks from other emerging literacies, we conceptualize demographic literacy as a multidimensional competence grounded in both demographic knowledge and its practical application. Empirically, we focus on demographic literacy about ageing, operationalized through the knowledge of two key demographic processes that characterize post-transitional societies: the increase in the older population and the decline in younger cohorts. Using a nationally representative survey of 1,575 adults (Ipsos–Osservatorio Senior, 2023) living in Italy - one of the world’s most aged societies - and adopting a Machine Learning (ML) approach, we examine the socio-demographic patterns of demographic knowledge about ageing. Results reveal that nearly one-third of respondents lack basic knowledge of population ageing, with marked educational and economic gradients: low education and low income significantly reduce the probability of correct understanding and reinforce each other in predicting demographic illiteracy. The pronounced social gradient in demographic knowledge limits the capacity of some groups to apply it, reducing their potential to convert knowledge into agency. These findings call for policies that promote demographic literacy as a lever for inclusion, empowering citizens to better understand and respond to population change.",

        "abstract": "Sociology has paid limited attention to the role of luck in shaping individual socioeconomic outcomes. This study examines how luck, conceptualized as chance events that provide or deplete resources for educational attainment, contributes to educational inequalities by family socioeconomic status (SES). We theorize that unexplained variance in regression models can serve as an indirect indicator of both good and bad luck. Building on the Breen and Goldthorpe model of educational inequality, we introduce a stochastic component and derive a novel hypothesis: luck plays a greater role, and thus generates more variability in outcomes, when structural resources and individual propensity for education are misaligned, specifically for low-SES students with high educational propensity and high-SES students with low propensity. We test this hypothesis using variance function regression models with sibling fixed effects on two U.S. datasets. The results support our expectations: educational outcomes are most volatile when parental SES and educational propensity diverge, particularly among low- SES students with high propensity, whose attainment appears most exposed to chance. We conclude by discussing implications for the emerging sociology of luck and for research on inequality and mobility more broadly.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To develop, calibrate, and evaluate a machine learning (ML) classifier designed to reduce citation screening workload for COVID-19 research. Methods: Citations from the WHO COVID-19 Research Database were used to train a logistic regression classifier, which was then calibrated using another independent dataset. A lower threshold was set, below which, records could be excluded from manual screening, and an upper threshold, above which, records could be automatically included into the database. The classifier was then validated on eight COVID-19 reviews to assess workload reduction and recall. Findings: The WHO-Cochrane-EPPI classifier was calibrated for 99% recall, with an upper threshold of 70% and a lower threshold of 39%. During validation, it achieved 98.6% recall across eight reviews. A smaller set of three reviews estimated a 12.5% workload reduction, with 1,390 of 11,153 records below the lower threshold. For database use, workload reduction was estimated at 80%, with 8,955 out of 11,153 records being automatically screened. Conclusion: The WHO-Cochrane-UCL classifier significantly reduces manual screening workload with minimal risk of missing studies. It serves as a model for integrating machine learning into curated resources like the WHO COVID-19 Research Database, improving sustainability by reducing manual screening efforts. The classifier can also be adapted for systematic reviews on COVID-19 and other topics.",

This study statistically investigates whether lunar phases influence the timing of childbirth in Japan using a dataset of 135,748 birth records collected via the web service charapla.net between 2010 and 2017. Methods: Lunar age (0–29) at birth was calculated for each individual, and expected frequencies were derived via a calendar-based simulation reflecting astronomical cycle length. The goodness-of-fit was analyzed using the Chi-square test and effect size (Cohen’s w). Results: The distribution was nearly flat, with no increased births near the New Moon or Full Moon. Although a statistically significant deviation was detected (χ²(29) = 55.43, p = 0.0022), the effect size was negligible (w = 0.02). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that there is no substantial association between lunar phases and birth rates in the contemporary Japanese population. The findings challenge popular belief and reinforce evidence-based medical and social decision-making.",

However, in social research relating to nutrition and health, academic-industry data sharing partnerships are rare. This exploratory research uses insights from a case study of a successful academic-industry data sharing partnership in social research to produce a pilot framework to aid the generation of industry-academia data sharing collaborations. Ten participants were interviewed: six from the University of Leeds, and four from a large UK supermarket, Sainsbury’s Plc, from different roles across the partnership. We used semi-structured interviews and analysed data using deductive reflexive thematic analysis. The resultant themes were organised into a preliminary framework based on the Data Sharing Pyramid (how raw data is transformed into wisdom through processing and interpretation). Our preliminary insights form the - Academia-Industry Partnership (AIP) framework - which constitutes four components: 1) the Research Infrastructure Foundation, where participants emphasised the importance of investing time and resources before starting research; 2) the Data Sharing Process, which involves applying principles of the research infrastructure foundation and robust data governance to enable sharing of novel commercially sensitive data; 3) the Research Process, which captured how shared data is used and the resulting outputs and impacts; and 4) the Partnership Strategy which focused on nurturing the partnership across all areas of the framework. This study uniquely uses a real-world case study to develop a preliminary framework, facilitating shared learnings for the development of data sharing partnerships in social research to further the use of commercial data for public good.",

A systematic search was conducted on the Scopus and Web of Science databases for relevant articles published between 2015 and 2024. The findings from 51 reviewed articles showed that recommendations for bias mitigation within healthcare tended to be grouped around seven key themes, namely diversity in teams, training and education, awareness and responsibility, diversity of data, collaboration with end users and beneficiaries, monitoring and evaluation, and transparency. While these recommendations provide useful suggestions for reducing bias, they generally fail to provide actionable guidance or empirical evidence about how these strategies can be operationalised in a real-world setting. More research is needed to test the effectiveness and practicality of these recommendations across different scientific and clinical contexts as well as among different types of development teams.",

        "abstract": "This paper argues that modern risk governance rests on a useful fiction: that technological safety can be rendered as objective fact. Within a “regime of functional objectivity,” institutions translate unruly hazards into standardized metrics that appear auditable, comparable, and decisive. That fiction works tolerably well because the uncertainties of most technologies can be bounded enough for regulation and coordination. The paper contends, however, that this regime has an epistemic boundary, past which the assumptions that support objectivity claims can no longer be safely ignored. Beyond this threshold lies a “regime of fractured objectivity,” where extreme stakes and sparse empirical feedback demand implausible certainty, small modeling choices dominate outcomes, and routine heuristics of expertise lose traction. The argument unfolds in four steps. First, it maps the civic epistemology that privileges technical consensus and procedural validation in technological risk, contrasting it with the plural, openly provisional treatment of economic risk. Second, it explains how this order is sustained by performances of objectivity that are methodologically valuable even if epistemologically fragile. Third, it draws on reactors to show how certain systems ‘fracture’ those performances by coupling catastrophic potential to hard limits on verification. Finally, it sketches the governance implications of operating beyond the boundary: cultivating varied expertise rather than a single authoritative voice, emphasizing resilience alongside risk calculation, and acknowledging that restraint may at times be the only responsible policy.",

While reducing poverty and increasing welfare, these policies have tended to remain technocratic, their democratic legitimacy being contested. This paper examines contemporary Western social policy in the light of Hannah Arendt’s distinction between making and acting. Making is the human condition of worldliness. We live in a world of durables and construct these durables through the process of making. Acting is the human condition of plurality. We live together with others and must therefore agree on the forms of our social life. For Arendt acting and making are strictly separate activities. Therefore, the means-ends schema plays no role in politics, which is about acting together. Thus, social policy is not about reaching a pre-defined outcome in technocratic fashion but about the negotiation and agreement on the forms of our social life.",

        "abstract": "Southern Central America played a key role in the continent-wide transition to the Neolithic and the transmission of its culture between South and Mesoamerica. Nevertheless, there has been a notable decline in linking processes within this region to contemporary developments in the rest of the continent. Here, there are early indicators of the Neolithic, besides evidence of the movement of cultigens and likely information about pottery manufacturing towards the other continent. Using a co-adaptive framework, I examine the social and ecological changes during the Archaic and Early Formative American Neotropics and adjacent regions, highlighting surprising networks that moved plants, goods and cultural systems during these periods. I focus mainly on the behaviors that link humans with their natural environments, beyond mere social changes occurring at the level of the producer. Finally, I present a Bayesian analysis of 161 radiocarbon dates from 39 sites in Costa Rica and Panama from the Late Archaic through the Middle Formative. These methods can identify anomalous dates and generate probability distributions regarding chronological questions about eight different material culture complexes: In Tilaran-Arenal, Fortuna* and Tronadora; in the Costa Rican Atlantic Watershed, La Montaña, in Gran Chiriquí, Talamanca*, Boquete* and Black Creek; and in Gran Coclé, the Preceramic B tradition and Monagrillo (archaic assemblages denoted with an asterisk*). I argue that there exists evidence for the early presence of ceramic from 4840-4144 BC cal, representing a correction to the established chronology of 1000-3000 years. Early ceramic complexes commonly interpreted as Formative coexisted with Archaic-period assemblages for hundreds, if not thousands of years before the abandonment of archaic-style complexes. Therefore, the presence of ceramics is not a sufficient marker of social processes commonly associated with the Formative. Resumen: El Sur de Centroamérica jugó un papel crucial en la transición al Neolítico y en la transmisión de la cultura neolítica entre Sudamérica y Mesoamérica. A pesar de ello, se ha disminuido la relación de procesos en esta región con el resto del continente. Aquí se encuentran tempranos indicadores del Neolítico, evidencia del tránsito de cultígenos y probable información sobre alfarería hacia el otro continente. Examinando los procesos sociales y ecológicos durante el Arcaico y Formativo temprano en el Neotrópico Americano y regiones aledañas desde una perspectiva co-adaptiva, destaco la sorprendente movilidad de plantas, bienes y sistemas culturales durante estos periodos. Me enfoco en los comportamientos que vinculan a los humanos con sus ambientes, más allá de los procesos sociales a nivel productivo. Un análisis Bayesiano de 161 determinaciones radiométricas de 39 sitios en Costa Rica y Panamá, desde el Arcaico tardío hasta el Formativo medio, permite identificar las determinaciones aberrantes y generar distribuciones de probabilidad sobre cuestiones cronológicas para ocho diferentes complejos: en Tilarán-Arenal, Fortuna* y Tronadora; en el Vertiente Atlántico Costarricense, La Montaña; en el Gran Chiriquí, Talamanca*, Boquete*, y Black Creek; y en el Gran Coclé, Preceramic B* y Monagrillo (complejos arcaicos marcados con asterisco*). Argumento que existe evidencia de la presencia temprana de alfarería desde 4840 - 4144 a.C. cal, representando una corrección en la cronología establecida de 1000-3000 años. Los complejos cerámicos frecuentemente interpretados como Formativos coexistieron con los complejos Arcaicos durante cientos, sino miles, de años antes del abandono de complejos asociados con la caza-recolección. Así, la presencia plena de alfarería no puede considerarse como un marcador de los procesos sociales asociados con el periodo Formativo.",

This study examines how five LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Perplexity) respond to queries about media-related cases that occurred in the Basque Country between 2023 and 2025, as well as to general questions on current affairs at local, regional, and national levels. The methodology was based on the use of prompts applied under controlled technical conditions, with responses evaluated in terms of length, source citation, traceability, and territorial contextualisation. The findings reveal that ChatGPT and Perplexity offer the most extensive, traceable, and contextually rich responses, while Claude and Gemini display notable opacity and limited regional coverage. A systematic tendency to prioritise national media is observed, even in queries concerning local and regional issues, thereby limiting informational diversity. These differences are not merely technical but structural, stemming from corpus design, retrieval architecture, and licensing agreements between media outlets and developers, which together create a territorial information gap in the use of generative AI.

        "abstract": "Multiplayer video games are part of everyday activities posing the question of which of these digital settings cluster crime or other deviant behaviour. A superficial analysis of the literature suggests that the evidence on cybercrime inside video games is scarce and a considerable number of digital settings have not been explored. This systematic review critically addresses the body of work that has studied the connection between video games and crime from the perspective of Environmental criminology and the Criminology of Place. The review is guided by two hypothesis on crime clustering on cyberspace: (1) the literature on video games and crime has focus in a small number of titles (2) the literature on video games and crime is more prone to understand video games as factor that can trigger victimization or perpetration in offline spaces rather than a setting in which cybercrime can manifest. Through the analysis of 41 studies published between 2014 and 2024 following the PRISMA model, our results show that there is indeed and overrepresentation of some cyber places within research around video games and crime. Likewise, the literature most frequently studies the effects of video games on perpetration or victimisation. The implications of the study are discussed within the context of the debate on the risks associated with playing video games and the limitations of our understanding of which video games are criminogenic virtual environments.",

        "abstract": "Theoretical and computational accounts of prehistoric warfare and migration frequently assume stochastic encounter probabilities of conflict and dispersal among forager groups. This review challenges that assumption. Synthesising ethnographic, archaeological, and ancient-DNA evidence, I demonstrate that both lethal conflict and dispersal in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene were systematically constrained by spatial proximity and kinship structure. Distance imposes energetic and informational costs that restrict routine interactions to neighbouring groups, while genealogical relatedness modulates cooperation and violence. Across studies, intergroup conflict concentrates at boundaries between genetically dissimilar communities. Migration follows short-range, kin-biased pathways producing spatial gradients of relatedness. Contradictory findings derive from methodological limitations and do not invalidate the predominant pattern. Recognizing warfare and migration as structured processes clarifies selective pressures shaping cooperation and offers an empirical basis for interpreting localized violence, displacement patterns, and institutional resilience in contemporary populations.",

        "created": "2025-11-20",
        "abstract": "What factors lie behind bureaucrats’ readiness to delegate client interactions that commonly involve human empathy to artificial intelligence (AI) systems? Such delegation entails a crucial trade-off as it may reduce workload but simultaneously introduces inauthentic empathic engagement in citizen-state relations, which may undermine the moral integrity of public administration (PA). Drawing on bureaucratic legitimacy theory, this study tests the impact of efficiency gains, AI features, and organizational norms on civil servants’ willingness to delegate citizen engagement to AI. Findings from a pre-registered discrete choice experiment conducted with 300 active German civil servants (Obs.=3,000) show that while efficiency gains and norms do have some impact, utilitarian considerations concerning AI’s ability to serve clients well are clearly the most important motivator. The findings show that the acceptability of delegating empathic engagement with citizens to AI can be tied to key dimensions of bureaucratic legitimacy, and provide novel evidence that the delegation of counselling to AI in PA is more strongly linked with public service motivation rather than self-serving efficiency gains. These insights advance theory and inform responsible and client-centered use of AI in public bureaucracies.",

        "abstract": "Adolescence is widely recognised as a key life stage, yet its meaning and experience remain under-explored due to the complex interplay between biological and social transformations. While researchers across fields such as psychology and public health increasingly frame adolescence as a “critical period,” anthropology offers distinctive insights that challenge simplistic and reductionist accounts. This special issue introduces the Anthropology of Adolescence, situating the discipline as an important contributor to the emerging interdisciplinary interest in adolescence. Drawing on a century of anthropological engagement, we emphasise adolescence not simply as a passage between childhood and adulthood, but as a dynamic biocultural stage through which broader social, political, and ecological processes can be understood. The contributions presented here span different forms of anthropology, employing varied methods from structured interviews and focus groups to multimodal ethnographic research. Together, they demonstrate the breadth of anthropological research, foregrounding themes such as spatiality, intersectionality, and socialisation. In doing so, this issue illustrates why anthropology and adolescence go together, and how the discipline can enrich wider debates on this vital life stage.",

Although many corporations are developing biodiversity-related measures and reporting frameworks, their actual environmental awareness and responsibility remain critical. On 19 September 2025, the outdoor sports brand Arc’teryx held a large-scale fireworks event, Ascending Dragon in the Himalayas, in Shigatse, China, which drew widespread criticism for its potential negative environmental impacts. To evaluate the societal and financial consequences of this incident, we analyzed Chinese public responses based on Weibo discourse (public reaction), Baidu Search Index (public attention), and the stock performance of Anta, Arc’teryx’s parent company. Both reaction and attention peaked two days after the event, and we found a negative correlation between online trends and stock performance. Causal analysis further demonstrated a significant causal influence of Baidu search activity related to Anta on its stock price. Textual analysis revealed that public concern centered primarily on environmental impacts, followed by expectations of corporate responsibility. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a negative environmental event, together with the resulting public reaction and attention, can directly and immediately influence a company’s financial performance. These findings underscore the importance of genuine biodiversity awareness and responsible decision-making in corporate practice.",
