        "abstract": "Minoritised politicians often distance themselves from expectations associated with their group, possibly provoking backlash from in-group members. We coin the term broadstancing to describe such distancing from a minoritised in-group to broaden electoral appeal, and we provide the first empirical evidence of the effectiveness of this strategy for Muslim politicians. Using a survey experiment with 3,052 respondents in France, Germany, and the Netherlands, including an oversample of Muslim respondents, we examine voter responses to Muslim politicians who support or oppose contested policies associated with Muslims. We find that voters overall are significantly less biased against Muslim politicians who distance themselves from such policies. However, this strategy incurs in-group costs: Muslim voters are less likely to support Muslim politicians who engage in broadstancing. An important exception is gender equality, which is strongly preferred by voters across groups. These findings highlight both strategies for political acceptance and the conditionality of Muslim representation.",

        "abstract": "This working paper uses the Crown Dependency of Jersey as a case study to investigate young people's attitudes towards voting. Drawing on assemblage theory as a conceptual lens, we examine how interrelated aspects of young people's voting experiences shape engagement. Assemblage mapping is used to synthesise insights from focus groups with participants aged 18 to 24, identifying diverse yet related dimensions, including voting awareness, political exposure, social influence, social media dynamics, and confidence in the act of voting. Confirmatory Factor Analysis is then used to empirically validate these dimensions, operationalised as latent categories. We examine the sequence of awareness-building, political exposure, and social mediation using structural equation modelling, revealing how different configurations of these factors influence young people's perceptions of the importance of voting and their sense of confidence. Our findings show that pathways in which political exposure precedes awareness differ markedly from those in which awareness develops without sufficient exposure or social support. We further show that social media engagement plays a key role, either encouraging or limiting participation depending on how it is positioned within the structural model. Our work highlights that low youth turnout reflects a complex disconnection influenced by both personal relationships and institutional factors, with implications for interventions designed to foster meaningful engagement among young voters.",

        "authors": "Sanne van Oosten",
        "created": "2026-01-07",
        "abstract": "Survey research on racial/ethnic minority citizens of Germany and the Netherlands tends to use the category migration background, instead of measuring whether that category has any meaning for respondents by asking how they identify. Through surveying 1864 respondents in Germany and the Netherlands, including 401 respondents with a background in Türkiye, this paper shows that those who identify as Turkish hold different attitudes than those who have a background in Türkiye but who identify as German or Dutch. I provide proof of this with attitudes towards topics often associated with citizens with a migration background: belonging, Islam and sexuality. Respondents with a background in Türkiye, who do not identify as Turkish, hold the same attitudes as those without a migration background, and significantly different attitudes than when a researcher would categorize them with those having a migration background in Türkiye. This demonstrates that using identification rather than categorization yields more accurate and meaningful insights into respondents’ attitudes. Beyond this empirical advantage to identification over categorization, this paper outlines additional conceptual, methodological, and normative advantages to measuring identification in surveys.",

        "abstract": "This article interprets the Arab Spring as the terminal phase of a long electoral cycle, introduced in the article as an analytical concept capturing the long-term dynamics of authoritarian regimes in the region. In contrast to dominant socio-economic and diffusion-based explanations, the analysis foregrounds the temporal dimension of political instability and the phenomenon of regime aging. It demonstrates that by 2010–2011 a substantial share of Arab autocracies had simultaneously entered a phase of legitimational exhaustion, coinciding with electoral and quasi-electoral points of vulnerability, including elections, constitutional amendments, and succession crises. From this perspective, the Arab Spring is understood as the outcome of the synchronization of these processes rather than as a series of isolated national crises.",

        "authors": "Manasi Sandeep Mohite, Rahul Shashikant Gaikwad",
        "created": "2025-12-31",
        "abstract": "India’s socio-economic transformation represents an emancipatory project whose achievements, though significant, remain structurally circumscribed. Constitutional equality, affirmative action, and the expansion of public education weakened entrenched forms of exclusion and enabled segments of historically marginalised communities to attain limited upward mobility, securing entry into formal employment and the lower middle strata. Yet this advancement has not culminated in durable economic elevation or meaningful access to elite positions, exposing a persistent disjunction between juridical liberation and substantive class mobility. This paper interrogates the paradox of chains broken yet ladders blocked by examining the structural constraints that impede progression beyond the middle tiers. Drawing upon economic and sociological perspectives, it demonstrates how asymmetries in access to land, financial capital, elite educational institutions, and influential social networks continue to govern patterns of wealth accumulation and occupational stratification across generations. It further contends that post-liberalisation growth, while expansive in aggregate terms, has recalibrated inequality by disproportionately valorising inherited assets and entrenched forms of cultural capital. The study concludes that India’s development must be assessed not merely through growth metrics but through its capacity to institutionalise inclusive and intergenerational mobility.

        "created": "2025-12-31",
        "abstract": "There has been a national security turn in China that has marked a shift in modus operandi from ‘development-first’ to ‘security-first’, but why would the leadership downplay a highly legitimising governance approach that has underpinned China’s massive growth rates and the basis of regime survival for over 40 years? This article problematises dominant explanations that centre great power competition, adopting instead a Gramscian approach that takes seriously the domestic and transnational sources of state authority. We argue that China’s national security turn is best understood as a Caesarist hegemonic project defined by charismatic leadership, arbitration between social groups, and coercive rule, rooted in global, state and societal conflicts inherent to global capitalism. Driven by crisis-prone conditions of escalating US-China rivalry, intra-state factional stalemates over China’s industrial overcapacity, and deepening societal inequality, the article demonstrates how a Xi Jinping-led national security faction has sought to recalibrate the Chinese hegemonic project. In this light, the national security turn is not wholly a response to inter-state security competition but also a means to further extract the latent growth potential from China’s development model and consolidate the position of Chinese state actors and of China between a US-led Global North and China-led Global South.",

        "authors": "Takeru Eto",
        "created": "2026-01-06",
        "abstract": "Japan is currently engaged in three major territorial disputes: the Northern Territories, Takeshima, and the Senkaku Islands. While official government surveys consistently report high levels of public concern, respondents may overstate their engagement due to social desirability bias. To address this, this paper employs a list experiment through an online opt-in survey of 4,500 Japanese citizens to estimate the proportion of the population that is privately indifferent to each dispute. Using AMEs from an ICT regression model, the results reveal substantial levels of hidden indifference: approximately 19% for Takeshima, 11% for the Senkaku Islands, and 5% for the Northern Territories. Crucially, this indifference is not randomly distributed but is systematically structured by socioeconomic and geographic factors. The analysis shows that indifference is significantly higher among individuals in precarious employment. Furthermore, residents of metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo and Kinki region, exhibit greater indifference toward Takeshima and the Senkaku Islands, while people in closer proximity to these territories tend to be more engaged. Interestingly, however, residents in Hokkaido, the region closest to the Northern Territories, exhibit higher latent indifference than the national average, potentially indicating a divergence between local pragmatic interests and national narratives. These findings challenge the conventional view of a uniformly concerned public and suggest that domestic political constraints on diplomatic compromise may be more flexible than commonly assumed.",

        "abstract": "- Abstract While guilt is traditionally characterized as a moral emotion that motivates individuals to repair damaged social bonds, this paper investigates conditions under which this reparative impulse comes into tension with the ethical demand for honesty. We conceptualize Short-Term Relational Focus (STRF) as a multi-level phenomenon encompassing evolutionary pressures for social cohesion, psychological mechanisms of ego-protection, and ethical tensions between immediate harmony and long-term integrity and epistemic clarity. Drawing on experimental evidence (Li &amp; Jain, 2021), organizational observations, and philosophical perspectives from Kant, Nietzsche, and Aristotle, the paper develops a bidirectional framework for understanding social repair. This framework examines the Guilt–Honesty Paradox from both the sender’s and the receiver’s perspective, highlighting how attempts at relational repair may unintentionally undermine trust, learning, and accountability. The paper further outlines practical strategies—supported by case illustrations, tables, and applied examples across organizational, educational, healthcare, and digital contexts—for reconciling concern for relationships with commitments to truthfulness.

        "abstract": "Housing markets are more complex than a simple supply-demand relationship. Prices are set by complex market and spatial neighborhood dynamics. Certain cities like St. Louis, MO have experienced dramatic population decline marked by extreme vacancy and abandonment. Amidst its population decline, St. Louis simultaneously demonstrates neighborhoods with sharp housing shortages and competition alongside others with entrenched vacancy and disinvestment mere blocks away from one another. We use supervised machine learning models to predict housing prices with a diverse feature set that incorporates spatial aspects of vacancy among other traditional housing amenities in St. Louis. Our results show how proximity to vacancy may impact a home’s value even more than its number of bedrooms. These findings, we expect, may prompt policymakers to combat vacancy even more urgently to maintain neighborhood market stability.",

        "abstract": "This paper, \"The Geometry of Power,\" presents a path-integral framework for analyzing the dynamics of political regimes under uncertainty. Whereas the earlier work, The Calculus of Power, focused on optimal paths, the present approach replaces single optimal paths with ensembles of permissible political histories, each weighted by an action functional. In this paper, we also introduce the concepts of path entropy, state entropy, and free action to describe the structures of political accessibility and strength. We then used Monte Carlo simulations, calibrated with political, economic, and conflict indicators, to test the validity of the framework on six East African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. The aim of the analysis is to evaluate the relative accessibility of democratic, authoritarian, military, and collapsed regime endpoints. The results show that the stability of regimes and shifts is governed not only by minimizing costs but also by the “entropy of the geometry” that shapes rational political behavior under uncertainty. Authoritarian regimes are found to be structurally strong under prevailing regional constraints. However, democratic transitions are restricted to narrow and fragile pathways.",

        "abstract": "We study a large-scale intervention designed by civil society organizations to reduce vote buying in Uganda’s 2016 elections. We study this intervention in light of a model where incumbents benefit from a first-mover and campaigning advantage, vote buying and on-the-ground canvassing are complementary, and voter reciprocity increases the effectiveness of vote buying. The intervention undermined reciprocity as well as the drivers of the campaigning advantage of incumbents. As a result, challengers not only canvassed more intensively but also bought more votes in treated locations. Consistent with incumbents being first movers in markets for votes and facing more frictions to adjust their tactics than challengers, their response to the intervention was limited. The intervention ultimately failed to reduce vote buying, but led to short-run electoral gains for challengers and increased service delivery in treated locations.",

        "abstract": "Survey research yields the surprising conclusion that voters strategically abandon small parties to a similar degree in first-past-the-post (FPTP) and proportional representation (PR) systems. If true, this challenges Duverger's classic theory that strategic voting helps explain why PR systems have more parties. We argue instead that observational analyses of FPTP and PR elections produce similar patterns of apparently strategic voter behavior because they suffer from the same methodological flaw. After reproducing previous findings in a more comprehensive dataset, we show via placebo tests that the same research design would erroneously imply strategic behavior in non-strategic outcomes like party identification. We also show that a more rigorous design reduces but does not eliminate the problem. Our findings suggest that isolating the effect of party popularity on vote choice using observational data may be fundamentally more difficult than the literature has recognized, and that alternative approaches are needed.",

        "abstract": "This paper replicates and extends the study of Li et al. (2025) to investigate the role of feature engineering in machine learning (ML)-based cross-sectional stock return prediction. We construct a 3-tier feature system with 78 effective features, including basic financial ratios, financial change features, and growth quality features, using CRSP and Compustat data. Through a recursive rolling window approach from 1969 to 2018, we compare the performance of boosted regression trees (BRT), neural networks (NN), and the newly added extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models. The results show that XGBoost produces the highest accuracy in prediction since it captures statistical correlations among features efficiently, while it underperforms in terms of investment return due to its sensitivity to limited feature quality and the gap between statistical fitting and economic profitability. On the contrary, the BRT model generates the most robust performance for a strategy since it is more tolerant of noisy features within an incomplete information environment. Compared with Li et al. (2025), our strategy exhibits a lower Sharpe ratio and an insignificant risk-adjusted alpha. It is mainly due to the smaller number of features and the different sample period. This paper confirms the core conclusion of the original paper that feature engineering rather than model complexity is crucial for ML investment strategies.

        "abstract": "As conversational AI systems become increasingly integrated into everyday life, they raise pressing concerns about user autonomy, trust, and the commercial interests that influence their behavior. To address these concerns, this paper develops the Fake Friend Dilemma (FFD), a sociotechnical condition in which users place trust in AI agents that appear supportive while pursuing goals that are misaligned with the user’s own. The FFD provides a critical framework for examining how anthropomorphic AI systems facilitate subtle forms of manipulation and exploitation. Drawing on literature in trust, AI alignment, and surveillance capitalism, we construct a typology of harms, including covert advertising, political propaganda, behavioral nudging, and surveillance. We then assess possible mitigation strategies, including both structural and technical interventions. By focusing on trust as a vector of asymmetrical power, the FFD offers a lens for understanding how AI systems may undermine user autonomy while maintaining the appearance of helpfulness.",

We introduce a contract-aware virtual experimentation framework that combines large-scale simulated responses with small human validation samples to enable rigorous, low-cost pre-testing of sustainability interventions. The approach treats synthetic labels as noisy measurements and applies link-space calibration to restore nominal coverage and reduce mean squared error under explicit external-validity assumptions. Using two canonical hospitality interventions—normative appeals for towel reuse and gamified strategies for buffet waste reduction—we show that episodic conditioning improves predictive fidelity, yielding calibrated estimates that closely approximate field benchmarks (reuse ≈ +6.5 percentage points; waste ≈ −32%). Monte Carlo diagnostics confirm that coverage approaches 95% and precision improves as validation size grows. This study contributes a reproducible econometric workflow for virtual experimentation in tourism, offering a scalable, ethically responsible complement to field trials.",

        "abstract": "In recent decades, the pharmaceutical industry has consolidated itself as one of the most powerful sectors of the global economy and, beyond innovation, sustains part of that power through controversial strategies of marketing, lobbying, and influence over research, regulation, clinical guidelines, and medical practice itself. This science report synthesizes the main findings of the study “Relationships and Influences of the Pharmaceutical Industry on Medical Practice”, based on an analysis of Open Payments (CMS), the United States’ public system that records transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. The data indicate that, between 2015 and 2024, manufacturers reported about US$ 23.2 billion in payments to physicians and US$ 23.3 billion to teaching hospitals, highlighting the scale of a mechanism that operates through both large contracts and everyday “courtesies.” The reviewed international literature converges in associating these benefits with changes in prescribing patterns - often subtle and even unconscious - including a greater preference for brand-name drugs, closer alignment with products from paying companies, and increased costs for health systems, sometimes with marginal clinical gains. Edge cases, such as controversies involving Xarelto and the Insys/Subsys promotional scheme amid the opioid crisis, illustrate how incentives and promotion can approach illicit practices, although the more common influence is discreet and routine. The report discusses explanatory mechanisms from social psychology and communication - reciprocity, self-serving bias, and the third-person effect - and highlights the central role of meals and small gifts, with evidence of a dose–response effect, suggesting that repeated interactions may increase receptivity to promotional messages even without physicians’ conscious awareness. Finally, it addresses the “hidden curriculum” in medical schools and argues that transparency and caps on gifts are insufficient, advocating structural responses: stronger restrictions and transparent, institutional funding models with independent governance to protect clinical integrity, reduce conflicts of interest, and preserve public trust.",

        "abstract": "Culture is not just traits but a dynamic system of interdependent beliefs, practices and artefacts embedded in cognitive, social and material structures. Culture evolves as these entities interact, generating path dependence, attractor states and tension, with long-term stability punctuated by rapid systemic transformations. Cultural learning and creativity is modelled as coherence-seeking information processing: individuals filter, transform and recombine input in light of prior acquisitions and dissonance reduction, thereby creating increasingly structured worldviews. Higher-order traits such as goals, skills, norms and cognitive gadgets act as emergent metafilters that regulate subsequent selection by defining what counts as coherent. Together, these filtering processes self-organise into epistemic niches, echo chambers, polarised groups and institutions that channel information flows and constrain future evolution. In this view, LLMs and recommender algorithms are products of cultural embeddings that now act back on cultural systems by automated filtering and recombination of information, reshaping future dynamics of cultural systems.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. has undergone substantial changes in jobs, occupations, and mobility over the last two decades. Using administrative data from the U.S. Occupational Outlook Handbook (2000–2020), we examine how immediate and projected occupational restructuring affects workers’ mobility. In an update to prior research, we find that workers in both growing and declining occupations experience greater mobility than those in stable occupations. However, the direction of movement varies. Workers in declining occupations often move laterally into other declining occupations, with nearly 60% experiencing downward mobility. In contrast, growing occupations offer better prospects for upward mobility, particularly for workers transitioning from declining to growing occupations, where almost 50% enter higher-paying occupations. Yet, such moves to emerging jobs are relatively rare, accounting for only 5% of all occupational movements. These results highlight how recent shifts in the occupational structure exacerbate existing disadvantages for workers facing declining job opportunities.",

        "abstract": "Formal modelling provides a toolkit for understanding cultural dynamics, from individual decisions to recurring patterns of change. This chapter explains what models are and why they matter. Using a precise, shared language, they aid thinking and communication by turning fuzzy assumptions into clear, comparable, testable claims. The chapter describes the modelling process, trading explanatory clarity against predictive specificity. Four families of models are surveyed, from the micro-level with optimising agents to macro-level dynamics with heuristic or even implicit agents, covering reasoning (Bayesian inference, game theory), adaptive updating (reinforcement learning, evolutionary games), mean-field approaches (compartmental models, population dynamics), and complex systems (agent-based models, social networks). Building on these, a general template for modelling cultural evolution is outlined that connects system states, cognitive processes, behaviour, and macro-level outcomes in dynamic loops, linking individuals, groups, institutions, and their environments. Taken together, these tools support a pluralist but coherent understanding of cultural change.",

Este reportaje científico sintetiza los principales hallazgos del estudio “Relaciones e Influencias de la Industria Farmacéutica sobre la Práctica Médica”, basado en el análisis de Open Payments (CMS), sistema público de Estados Unidos que registra transferencias de valor a médicos y hospitales universitarios.

La literatura internacional revisada converge en asociar estos beneficios con cambios en el patrón de prescripción – a menudo sutiles e incluso inconscientes –, incluyendo mayor preferencia por medicamentos de marca, mayor alineación con productos de las empresas pagadoras y aumento de costos para los sistemas de salud, en ocasiones con ganancias clínicas marginales.

        "abstract": "This research critically examines the Khoti system in the Konkan region of western India as a historical manifestation of agrarian exploitation, wherein intermediary landlords imposed exorbitant rents upon cultivators – predominantly from marginalized castes – systematically depriving them of land ownership, rights, and dignity. Situating this feudal framework within the broader socio-economic discourse, the study investigates how entrenched hierarchies sustained structural inequality and economic disenfranchisement. Central to the analysis is Dr. B. R. Ambedkar’s constitutional vision, which redefined Indian democracy through the inseparable pursuit of social and economic justice. His transformative legal architecture not only dismantled exploitative land relations but also facilitated the emergence of an inclusive middle class across diverse sectors. Employing a historical-analytical methodology, this paper interrogates the transition from feudal dependency to constitutional empowerment by engaging with economic theory, constitutional provisions on equality, abolition of untouchability, and land reforms. By juxtaposing pre- and post-Constitutional realities, the research elucidates how juridical reform can function as an instrument of social emancipation and equitable redistribution. Ultimately, this study contributes to global discourses on agrarian justice by positioning India’s constitutional experience as a replicable model for reform, capable of addressing similar socio-economic inequities in other parts of the world.

(2021), “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush: Technology search strategies and competition due to import penetration,” which examines how import penetration affects firms’ technology search strategies, distinguishing between exploration (new knowledge) and exploitation (refining existing knowledge). We replicate this work to interrogate its assumptions, including the exogeneity of instruments (tariffs and exchange rates) affecting search only through import penetration, the linearity of effects, potential omitted variable bias from domestic confounders (e.g., firm size, R&amp;D intensity, domestic competition), and sample biases toward larger firms due to missing data filters, which may limit generalizability in complex global trade domains. Employing the original IV method in R with publicly available datasets (NBER Patent Data, CRSP-Compustat, and Peter Schott’s trade data) for U.S. manufacturing firms from 1991 to 2006, we yield 5,076 firm-year observations from 319 firms, closely matching the original after sales adjustments. We extend the analysis using XGBoost machine learning to assess variable importance in a non-linear, multivariate context, excluding tautological variables (e.g., total_cites, patent_stock_lag). The IV replication successfully reproduces the original outcomes: increased import penetration, instrumented by tariffs and exchange rates, significantly reduces technological exploration (mean = 0.038) and increases exploitation (mean = 0.962) across 3,259 observations with non-zero citations. Surprisingly, the XGBoost extension reveals that import penetration adds minimal predictive power (not in the top 10), with firm fundamentals (e.g., xrd, sale, capx) and domestic competition metrics (total_sim, hhi) dominating rankings—China-specific penetration ranks modestly (#8–#9). This coherently links to the original’s assumptions by highlighting omitted confounders and non-linear interactions that overstate foreign shocks’ causal role, implying domestic and internal drivers primarily shape search strategies in global environments and calling for nuanced policies beyond trade protections.",

Some people define success as a scarce and exclusive resource, which is referred to as the “zero-sum construal of success”. This viewpoint will weaken individuals’ tendency to actively help others and their willingness to share knowledge. This study aims to evaluate whether the zero-sum construal of success has a predictable structural basis shaped by macroeconomic and social-status factors. We based our research on replicating the research of Sirola and Pitesa (2017), using Bayesian regression and XGBoost models introduced to empirically assess the predictability of the zero-sum construal of success. We find little evidence supporting the replicability of the original findings. The research results indicate that zero-sum belief is not a randomly formed attitude tendency but a psychological cognitive structure constructed by socioeconomic factors. It also shows that economic pressure affects individuals at the emotional level, and it shapes competitive cognitive paradigms through learnable social mechanisms. The findings of this study provide a new research perspective for understanding the relationship between economic cycle fluctuations and social psychological changes.",

Methods: Integrative review of 41 empirical studies on contextual determinants of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) sustainment and scale-up, interpreted through implementation science, policy implementation research, and welfare policy literature. Results: Three mechanisms were identified as crucial for sustaining and scaling up: Policy Legitimacy: normative acceptability and institutional compatibility that enables mandates and political-administrative authorization; Policy Embedding: coherence of multi-level, cross-sector governance arrangements that routinise the intervention beyond pilots; and Policy Learning: cumulative implementation evidence infrastructure enabling comparable measurement, feedback, and authorized adaptation. Conclusion: The proposed Legitimacy–Embedding–Learning (LEL) Framework for Scale-Up holds that scaling complex interventions is a configuration challenge within complex systems, rather than a linear dissemination task. The framework may support proactive adaptation when scaling IPS and similar interventions.",

This pursuit, however, raises a difficult question for the day-to-day work and governance of our research community: How can we support peripheral forms of theorizing without unduly impairing peers who prefer dominant forms of theorizing? In this paper, we propose a new answer to this longstanding question. Organizational researchers should embrace – and, in particular, cite – preprints in their theorizing. To underpin this proposal, we reconceptualize preprints as a liminal genre of scholarly communication that sits between peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed genres. Equipped with the unique characteristic of epistemic uncertainty, preprints offer researchers who embrace them new possibilities for rigorous theorizing. These new possibilities open up in particular for peripheral forms, such as interpretative or speculative theorizing, and thus support pluralism without interfering with the dominant forms of theorizing. Finally, to facilitate a nuanced debate about the future of preprints in organizational research, we discuss some of the puzzles, pitfalls, and perturbations to be expected if preprints become embraced as legitimate building blocks of theorizing.",

        "abstract": "It is increasingly common to study mobility and migration of individuals between social and physical locations as networks in which locations are nodes connected by mobile people. This conceptualisation as mobility networks facilitates the analysis of how individuals influence one another in their mobility destinations. Technically, this amounts to analysing interdependence between individuals’ mobility paths. A recently proposed framework – the endogenous log-linear model (ELMo) – allows the statistical modelling of these social processes and, therefore, dependence in mobility, combining insights from exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and log-linear models. However, little attention was paid to how such models should be specified in a principled, theoretically informed way. In this study, we apply statistical theory to propose model specifications that can be used to analyse emergent structures in mobility. We first reformulate the model under analysis as a conditional multinomial logit with dependent observations. Subsequently, we show how to specify models that (i) are based on clear dependence assumptions on the individual level, that (ii) have a clear individual level interpretation, and that (iii) avoid (near-)degeneracy, a common problem for models with dependent observations. We end with an example application pertaining to the mobility of computer science faculty between university departments.",

While cross-sectional methods are commonly used, engagement patterns are inherently temporal, making longitudinal approaches more appropriate. These methods offer a middle ground between simple cross-sectional analyses and complex time-series techniques, reducing omitted variable bias and accounting for time-varying factors like algorithmic amplification while accommodating irregular social media data. We empirically compare these approaches using 1,137 environmentally themed Facebook posts from German political parties during the 2021 federal election, focusing on Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and Die Grünen (The Greens), parties with opposing environmental policies. Cross-sectional estimates using three sampling strategies were compared with longitudinal results via Bayesian multilevel regression with negative binomial specification. Findings reveal that longitudinal modeling produces more conservative and precise estimates, while cross-sectional methods tend to inflate effect sizes and interparty differences. Although all models show anger positively associates with sharing for AfD and negatively for Die Grünen, longitudinal analysis provides greater inferential stability by controlling for time-invariant confounders. Such differences have important theoretical implications, underscoring the value of incorporating temporal dynamics into social media research while acknowledging data access challenges.",

This article systematically examines off-diagonal occupational mobility patterns beyond big social class effects and gradational affinities. We investigate whether micro-class mobility is primarily determined by origin-specific aspirations or similarities in human, cultural, and social capital between micro-classes. Drawing on data from the General Social Surveys in the United States and Germany, we employ a new structural modelling approach that integrates log-linear models and network methodology. Our findings reveal distinct micro-class mobility patterns shaped by institutionalized “mobility corridors,” with concentrated mobility along specific origin-destination paths after accounting for big-class and gradational characteristics. These patterns are asymmetrical, with elevated mobility rates from micro-class A to B not reciprocated from B to A. This asymmetry indicates that individuals target specific micro-classes based on origin-specific aspirations rather than relying on symmetric resource transferability. Thus, we demonstrate the mechanisms by which micro-classes shape intergenerational mobility beyond gradational affinities and big-class effects.",

This study contributes by applying a life-course-sensitive decomposition to linked survey-register data for Germany (SHARE-RV), decomposing gender gaps in public and private pensions based on common work-family life courses. It considers the interdependencies of employment, family life, and earning positions over the life course, relevant due to pension privatization in Europe. GPGs occur because privileged life courses (stable civil servant careers for public and high-income employment for private pensions) yield high pensions but are almost exclusively accessible by fathers. Gender differences in access to high-income careers for parents drive the GPG in private pensions more than the gap in public pensions. The study underscores the future risk of high GPGs given the persistently high Gender Wage Gap and pension privatization in Germany.",

        "abstract": "This article investigates how \"host country effects\" shape the organization of online platform work in the context of meal delivery, using Lieferando—the market leader in both Germany and Austria—as a case study. Contrary to initial expectations that platform companies would diffuse globally standardized models of \"gig work,\" Lieferando has pursued sharply divergent employment strategies in these two coordinated market economies: shifting to subcontracted delivery in Germany and adopting free service contracts (\"Freie Dienstverträge\") in Austria. Both changes have resulted in deteriorated conditions for delivery couriers, reflecting the influence of distinct national legal frameworks, institutional traditions, and the evolving strategies of transnational investors following the acquisition of Lieferando’s parent, Just Eat Takeaway, by Prosus. Despite robust traditions of employee representation and collective bargaining in both countries, recent developments underscore the vulnerability of platform workers to regulatory loopholes, capital-driven restructuring, and declining labour standards.",

        "abstract": "Selective college admissions shape access to opportunity in U.S. higher education, yet researchers have limited systematic evidence on how institutions' publicly stated admissions priorities relate to who enrolls. We ask whether colleges and universities that report considering alumni familial relation—\"legacy status\"—enroll smaller shares of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority (URM) first-year students. We compile a new panel of Common Data Set (CDS) reports from highly selective U.S. institutions spanning the 2010–2022 admissions cycles and collapse it to institution-level measures. After adjusting for sector and for the broader bundle of reported admissions priorities, institutions that report considering legacy status enroll roughly 7–8 percentage points fewer URM students. The pattern persists under alternative control constructions, functional forms, and influence checks. Legacy ratings change rarely within institutions over this period, so the association is driven primarily by stable differences across institutions. In our elite sample, the binary legacy contrast is identified among public institutions. Treating CDS admissions priorities as standardized organizational signals, our CDS-based approach provides a replicable framework for tracking how institutions' stated priorities align with enrollment composition—an issue likely to draw heightened attention in the post–Students for Fair Admissions environment.",

We compare respondents completing the survey on PCs/laptops and smartphones across indicators capturing cognitive load, satisficing, and respondent effort, including response latency, completion time, answer changes, page revisits, item nonresponse, midpoint use, “don’t know” responses, and straightlining. Descriptive analyses and multivariate models controlling for age, gender, and education show that most device differences are small or negligible. Smartphone use is not associated with longer completion times or systematically lower engagement once demographic composition is accounted for. The only robust and substantively meaningful device effect is a higher incidence of straightlining among smartphone respondents, alongside a very small increase in item nonresponse. Education consistently attenuates device-related differences. Overall, the findings indicate broad comparability across devices in a mobile-optimised survey, while highlighting specific behavioural domains where smartphones continue to shape response processes.",

        "abstract": "The literature on class has established that individuals can decode other people’s class backgrounds based on a variety of cues, such as verbal and nonverbal behavior. However, this scholarship has largely overlooked how first-generation migrants, who are socialized in a different cultural context, perceive class in their destination countries. Based on interviews and group discussions with 47 participants, this article investigates how first-generation migrants perceive class in Germany. Findings reveal that migrants struggle to decode class. The analysis identifies three key processes contributing to this illegibility of class: the cultural specificity of class cues, Germany’s comparatively low inequality and high affluence, and the prevalence of inconspicuous consumption. This inability to decode class can have significant behavioral consequences for migrants, potentially impacting their opportunities in the labor market and education. This study contributes to expanding research on class perceptions to a more diverse population and calls for a more thorough engagement with class perceptions in migration societies.",

        "abstract": "This paper begins from the premise that motivations for having (or not having) children are not fixed or purely personal, but socially constructed. These socially shaped motivations influence how young adults approach the prospect of parenthood and ultimately shape their fertility intentions. Yet existing research lacks a theoretical framework that clarifies how social influences on motivation become the psychological mechanisms driving such intentions and subsequent behaviors. We address this gap by integrating Self-Determination Theory with the Theory of Planned Behavior, proposing that socio-cognitive factors - attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control - affect fertility intentions not directly but through the type of motivation they foster, whether intrinsic, extrinsic, or amotivated. Using nationally representative survey data on Italian young adults and structural equation modeling, we show that fertility intentions depend less on socio-cognitive factors themselves and more on the motivational orientations they generate. Intrinsic motives are associated with stronger intentions, whereas extrinsic and amotivated forms correspond to weaker or absent commitments. These findings underscore the importance of considering motivational type in fertility research and demonstrate the value of a TPB-SDT integrated framework for explaining variation in fertility intentions across individuals and social contexts.",

        "authors": "Nawa Raj Subba",
        "created": "2026-01-06",
        "abstract": "This review paper examines interdisciplinary evidence to conclude that the syncretic matrix of Bon and indigenous Kirat traditions served as the basic ceremonial substrate for all subsequent organised religion in Nepal. In contrast to legends of late Bon introduction, we show that it was present in all five Nepalese regions by 1500 BCE: Kathmandu Valley, eastern and western hills, southern lowlands, and northern highlands. The data suggest a generative synthesis, a pragmatic \"ritual multiplex\" in which communities strategically code-switched between Kirat deep ontology and Bon's spirit-management techné. This complex, which adapted so well to its surroundings, predates Buddhist and Hindu influences by over a thousand years and has shown a remarkable continuity through the Licchavi era (300-750 CE), during which its base rituals were layered over, rather than supplanted. In short, today’s Ningwaphu heritage must be constituted not as a fresh blend, but as a direct descendant of this ancient amalgam, which has survived for 3,500 years through a series of adaptations. All these observations raise the need for a paradigm shift in the historiography of the religious traditions of the Himalaya region. We must forsake linear conceptions of cultural replacement and Sanskritization in favour of indigenous agency and syncretism as the driving forces. This transforms Nepal from a passive borderland to an active, generative furnace of early trans-Himalayan trade. The article concludes by describing a new, substrate-centric research program aimed at completely mapping this independent and complicated archaic heritage.",

        "created": "2026-01-02",
        "abstract": "Disclaimer: This paper is written as an applied sociological guide for students, community members, and emerging activists interested in building reform-oriented social movements. Rather than advancing a narrow empirical claim for peer-reviewed journals, the paper is intentionally pedagogical and praxis-oriented, integrating multiple sociological theories to demonstrate how theory can be translated into real-world organizing social movement strategies. Abstract: This blueprint is designed for emerging activists, students, and community members who want to build effective, reform oriented social movements but may not know where to begin. Using food insecurity and food deserts in Los Angeles County as a case study, the guide demonstrates how ordinary people can organize, mobilize resources, and create structural change without needing political power, institutional backing, or prior experience. The reading translates major sociological theories—including Resource Mobilization Theory, Framing Theory, Legal Consciousness Theory, Collective Action Frames, Political Process Theory, Performance Activism, and the Sociological Imagination—into clear, actionable strategies that beginners can apply in their own communities. Alongside theoretical grounding, the blueprint offers practical steps for securing funding, recruiting volunteers, framing injustice, engaging policymakers, and building real-world interventions such as community gardens. While centered on hunger, the framework is intentionally adaptable: the same tools can be used to address a wide range of social inequalities. This guide serves as an accessible, theory-informed roadmap for anyone ready to transform personal frustration into collective action and build a movement capable of creating meaningful, community-driven change.",

        "created": "2026-01-02",
        "abstract": "Theories on authoritarian resistance and violent collective action posit that individuals are likely to engage in protest behavior when they assess that: (i) politically organizing will achieve their objectives; and (ii) the gains received will outweigh the risks of punishment. Initially, citizens have incomplete information to make these judgments successfully. To obtain the necessary information, protesters rely on external sources, such as news or social media networks. Most importantly, however, is the information generated from neighbors and other nearby citizens. Social proof, where individuals seek optimal decision-making in times of uncertainty by observing the actions of others, is significant where criminal laws may be violated. Individuals’ apprehensions regarding government reprisal are mitigated when observing successful protests with analogous law enforcement conditions and comprising similar participants. Previous studies have demonstrated that geography exerts a pivotal influence on the diffusion of protests. Despite increasing use of communication technologies, I hypothesize that geography remains an important predictor of violent protest diffusion, specifically due to the ongoing necessity for social proof. This study provides both a substantive and methodological contribution. Substantively, this study analyzes a country that is in the process of democratic backsliding at an exponential rate, which is not considered in other papers on protest diffusion. Methodologically, I employ a novel Hawkes process model to assess violent protest data from Bangladesh and map the spatio-temporal clustering of events. Unlike prior uses of Hawkes processes in protest diffusion, this model accounts for continuous spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously, avoiding the artificial boundaries imposed by traditional spatial weight matrices. Ultimately, the findings demonstrate the enduring significance of geographic proximity in the diffusion of violent protests, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The analysis unveils distinct patterns of diffusion at varying geographical scales, underscoring the importance of administrative levels in discerning baseline intensities, triggering effects, and temporal decay rates.",

        "created": "2026-01-01",
        "abstract": "Open access has triumphed in the dissemination of research, making it widely available and discoverable beyond the confines of journal enclosures. The current challenge lies not in access, but in evaluation. While dissemination has evolved, scholarly judgment systems remain ensnared by opaque and anonymous gatekeeping. This study contends that governance, rather than quality, is the core issue. By synthesizing the literature on citations, trust, prestige, and scholarly behavior, we demonstrate that open research is extensively used, cited, and trusted by researchers. Journal branding serves as a residual signal, yet evaluative authority remains confined within closed processes that are misaligned with the ways knowledge is produced, encountered, and assessed. In response, we propose Governance by Guide (GG), a model for evaluating preprint-based scholarly commons. This model replaces gatekeeping with open, attributed guidance; rejection with non-erasure; and final verdicts with public records of critique and response. Evaluation becomes an additive process of stewardship rather than an act of certification. The ultimate evaluative authority rests with the sovereign reader empowered by transparency. We conclude that sustaining a credible open scholarly commons requires abandoning journal-centered certification in favor of transparent, community-governed evaluation. The GG offers a practical framework for achieving this realignment, aligning scholarly authority with openness, accountability, and lived research practice.",

Drawing on a bibliometric and vocabulary-based framing analysis of 2,241 English-language social science articles published between 1999 and 2024 and indexed in Scopus, the study examines titles and abstracts using theoretically informed dictionaries associated with institutionalist and post-structuralist approaches. The analysis uncovers a persistent theoretical dichotomy: institutionalist and post-structuralist viewpoints constitute separate conceptual clusters that influence the definition, explanation, and remediation of gender inequality in the literature. Alongside these dominant orientations, a small but enduring group of publications combines elements of both, while a broader residual category reflects neighboring disciplinary traditions. Longitudinal evidence shows that institutionalist and post-structuralist approaches have expanded concurrently rather than in a converging manner. The dual configuration sheds light on the persistence of unresolved debates within feminist scholarship and demonstrates the value of reflexivity regarding theoretical choices and their implications for policy-oriented research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a systematic study of the “Eight-Cord Pattern Pottery Plate” unearthed at the Liu Linxi site in Hubei Province, arguing that it is the material prototype of the lost archaic canon Ba Suo (The Eight Cords). The plate features a rigorous “eight-cord pattern” that constructs a standard eight-direction spatial framework, serving as the archetype of the “Eight Trigrams” (Bagua). Its symbolic system accurately encodes the eight key solar terms (including the equinoxes, solstices, and the commencements of the four seasons), constituting a precise “solar calendar.” Furthermore, through unique symbolic combinations such as “five-field,” it translates astronomical nodes into imperative agricultural directives, forming an “agricultural commandment.” The research achieves a comprehensive mutual verification between the artifact and the textual descriptions of Ba Suo (defined as “the theory of the Eight Trigrams, seeking its meaning”) from three dimensions: “name,” “function,” and “meaning.” This study reveals that the “Eight-Cord Pattern Pottery Plate” is not a divination tool but a “pre-literary comprehensive code” integrating cosmology, scientific observation, and administrative decrees. It signifies a key leap in Huaxia civilization from mystical symbols to rational governance around 7000 years ago, substantially pushing forward the evidential timeline for systematic knowledge and advanced governance models in Chinese civilization. 摘要： 本文通过对湖北柳林溪遗址出土的“八索纹陶盘”进行系统性研究，论证其为失传上古元典《八索》的物质原型。该陶盘以严整的“八索纹”构建了标准的八方空间框架，是为“八卦盘”之祖型；其符号系统精准编码了二分二至与四立等“八节”，构成一部精密的“太阳历”；更通过“五—田”等独创符号组合，将天文节点转化为刚性的农耕指令，形成一部“农时宪章”。研究从“名、实、义”三重维度，实现了该器物与文献所载《八索》（“八卦之说，求其义也”）的完整互证。本研究揭示，“八索纹陶盘”并非占卜之器，而是一部融合宇宙观、科学观测与政令的“前文字综合性法典”，标志着华夏文明在距今约7000年前，已实现了从神秘符号到理性治理的关键飞跃，将中华文明系统化知识与高级治理模式的实证年代显著提前。",

        "abstract": "Social tipping, the process by which a new behaviour spreads rapidly upon reaching a critical mass, offers a promising pathway for large-scale behavioural change. However, systematically designing interventions to trigger such tipping points remains a key challenge. This paper introduces a two-phase framework to guide researchers and policymakers in developing effective social tipping interventions. The first phase involves assessing the potential for social tipping by evaluating the prevalence of the target behaviour and the underlying preferences and social expectations that sustain it. We propose a method for eliciting individual thresholds for changing behaviour, distinguishing between conditional subjects (those who require social proof for changing behaviour) and unconditional subjects (those who are independent of others' decisions). The second phase uses the diagnostic information to inform strategic decisions about whom to target and how to intervene to activate the social tipping process. We analyze the trade-offs between targeting different subpopulations (e.g., amenable vs. resistant individuals) and propose a “stepping stone” approach that breaks down change into manageable steps, which can be particularly effective in populations with polarized individual thresholds. Taken together, our framework offers a roadmap for scaling up large-scale behavioural change through social tipping.",

        "abstract": "Background: Self-medication is a common practice among university students, particularly medical students, for minor illnesses without consultation with healthcare professionals. The use of antibiotics without prescription can pose public health risks, including antibiotic resistance. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 university students using a self-reported questionnaire. Information on self-medication practices for minor illnesses was collected. Data were analyzed for frequency, percentages, and associations between field of study and self-medication practices. Results: The overall prevalence of self-medication was 62%, with 67% among medical students and 45% among non-medical students. Headache was reported by 96% of students. Analgesics and antibiotics were the most commonly used medications, with 42% of students using antibiotics without a prescription. Major reasons for self-medication included previous experience, old prescriptions, and easy access from pharmacies. About one-third of students reported side effects. A statistically significant association was found between field of study and self-medication (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Self-medication is highly prevalent among university students, especially medical students. This behavior poses serious health risks, particularly due to unsupervised antibiotic use. Education, awareness campaigns, and strict regulations on over-the-counter medicines are recommended to mitigate these risks.",

It examines how housing challenges affect temporary migrants’ wellbeing, their ability to contribute economically, and the distinct housing issues they face. More than 10 per cent of Australian residents are on temporary visas and these migrants play an important role in the country’s economy. Despite this, the impact of the housing crisis on this group receives little attention. Temporary migrants are also often blamed for worsening the crisis, despite being ineligible for most housing supports.

Overall, we find nearly two-thirds of people in both FLC and non-FLC are worried about global warming, but the level of worry does not differ significantly between them. People in FLC have slightly greater worry about several climate change impacts, but they are not more likely to say they have personally experienced global warming.

        "abstract": "Context. Estimates suggest that 20–30 million Azerbaijanis live in Iran, a population two to three times larger than that of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Although officially recognised as a major ethnic and linguistic group, this recognition remains tightly bounded. Identity is largely confined to spoken language use, while cultural, educational, media, and political expressions have been persistently constrained. Objective. This study examines how Azerbaijani identity in Iran is formed, negotiated, and transformed under conditions of partial recognition and institutional constraint, with particular attention to recent identity awakening. Method. The study adopts a mixed qualitative design, combining a thematic literature review with semi-structured interviews and contextual analysis of developments since the early 2000s. Interview data were analysed iteratively using an identity-spectrum framework, supported by member checking and triangulation. Results. Increased visibility and articulation of Azerbaijani identity have occurred alongside continued suppression and selective recognition, producing asymmetric identity change. Individuals are more likely to shift toward stronger Azerbaijani identification following experiences of misrecognition, with collective arenas such as sport, media, activism, and politics amplifying these dynamics. Conclusion. Azerbaijani identity awakening in Iran is best understood as a structurally produced response to long-term recognition deficits rather than an externally driven process.",

        "abstract": "Survey data are increasingly collected using mixed-mode designs. However, the measurement of survey items may differ across modes, introducing ‘mode effects’, a type of systematic measurement error which can bias analyses of mixed-mode data. While the theoretical mechanisms giving rise to mode effects have been discussed in detail, the empirical evidence on their occurrence and size is fragmented. In addition, while many existing statistical approaches for handling mode effects require unrealistic assumptions, other more suitable approaches remain underutilised due to the need for external evidence on the magnitude of mode effects. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of the experimental literature on mode effects. We searched multiple bibliographic databases, grey literature sources, and implemented backwards and forwards citation screening. Studies eligible for inclusion were (quasi-)experimental, sampled from the general population (or age-, sex-, region-specific strata), and reported mode effect estimates on item measurement. We extracted comprehensive information relating to the study design, sampling, mode effect estimates, and reporting. Ninety experimental studies published between 1967 and 2024 met the inclusion criteria, which included 4,113 mode effect estimates for 3,545 unique variables in total. Mode effects were generally small, typically below 0.2 SD. However, larger mode effects were more commonly observed when modes differed by interviewer involvement or by question delivery (visual vs aural), as well as for sensitive items (e.g., sexual behaviour, social life), which aligns with pre-existing theory on the causes of mode effects. Generally, where mode effects occur, they are item-, mode-, and population-specific. Reporting quality varied substantially and insufficient details regarding randomisation compliance, non- response, and uncertainty of estimates were common. We collated all mode effect estimates into a free online database and provide a set of recommendations to improve the reporting of future studies.",

        "abstract": "The extent to which CEOs impact corporate performance remains one of the most contentious issues in strategic management. Previous research, most notably Fitza (2014), used ANOVA to decompose variance and showed that CEO effects are minimal after accounting for randomness. However, linear models ignore complex relationships and delayed leadership influence. This work replicates Fitza’s analysis and advances the argument by using XGBoost, a non-linear machine learning technique, on an enhanced dataset spanning 1999–2024 that includes Compustat, ExecuComp, and BoardEx data. Our model integrates comprehensive CEO traits (e.g., tenure, education, remuneration) as well as firm-level financial indicators, resulting in lagged variables across an eight-year period that capture both immediate and cumulative effects. The XGBoost model shows strong predictive performance (train R² = 0.675; test R² = 0.546), indicating significant explanatory power for firm performance. According to feature importance analysis, firm-level financial indicators dominate short-term prediction over CEO-related variables. A combined lag-year and entity-type study reveals that firm effects peak in the current year and then rapidly fall after two years, whereas CEO influence steadily grows until year three and then stabilizes over time. We can conclude from the data that business fundamentals are more important in predicting short-term outcomes, but the effect imparted by leadership requires more time to become apparent. This study provides a refined view of CEO influence by questioning past assumptions and showcases the potential of predictive modeling in corporate governance research.",

        "abstract": "The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) calls for expanded and more effective area-based conservation, including through Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs). In Australia, where much biodiversity occurs outside formal protected areas, voluntary private land conservation is critical, yet empirical evidence of its ecological and social effectiveness remains limited. This article presents a pre-approved Stage 1 protocol in Conservation Biology for a three-year, longitudinal mixed-methods study evaluating voluntary conservation interventions on private land. The study compares three intervention types: (1) non-binding area-based conservation programs, (2) citizen science and ecological engagement initiatives, and (3) combined participation in both. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the concept of noticing nature, the study examines how interventions influence landholder intentions, conservation behaviours, and ecological outcomes. Data collection includes repeated annual surveys, standardised ecological site assessments, and walk-along interviews. Quantitative analyses will use path regression to estimate relationships among interventions, psychosocial variables, and ecological indicators, complemented by inductive thematic analysis of qualitative data. As a registered Stage 1 protocol, no empirical results are reported. Past tense refers to completed study design and instrument development. Planned analyses will report effect sizes for changes in landholder attitudes, self-reported behaviours, and site-level ecological metrics across intervention types and time points. This protocol addresses a key evidence gap in voluntary private land conservation by providing a theoretically grounded, replicable framework for evaluating OECMs and engagement-based interventions, supporting more effective implementation of the GBF across working landscapes.",

        "abstract": "Academic open source contributors face a wide array of challenges, making it difficult for universities, support staff, and funders to determine which needs they should prioritize. To help address this problem, the University of California (UC) Open Source Program Office (OSPO) Network conducted a multi-campus survey of open source contributors and aspiring contributors. The goals of this survey were two-fold. First, we aimed to understand the needs of university open source contributors, so that we might design programs to address those needs. Second, we sought to characterize open source activity on campus, in order to assess the value of an OSPO. We received 294 valid responses from students, faculty, researchers, and staff. 93% of students and 92% of researchers report that open source software is important for their work. 58% of experienced open source contributors have served as project maintainers, indicating that a large number of university affiliates not only use open source software, they also build and maintain it. The most common challenge is lack of time, particularly time for writing documentation. Regarding opportunities for support, respondents strongly prioritized access to robust computing environments and dedicated grants for sustainability. Finally, comments revealed that institutional norms and priorities can sometimes impede contribution. The survey findings reveal diverse needs across contributor groups, with resources, infrastructure, and culture all playing a role. At the same time, the abundance of maintainers, the prevalence of time and funding-related challenges, and the comments regarding maintenance all underscore a critical need for support for open source sustainability. We conclude by recommending actionable strategies universities can adopt to incorporate sustainability into their open source initiatives.",

Here, we present a comprehensive scientific map based on grant data that uses semantic analyses (BERT-based topic modelling) to provide the overall landscape of science based on grant data from the European Union since 2003 (since the 6th framework programme). We find a disciplinary structure which is consistent with the circular shape of publication and citation based global science maps. However, this grant map shows a much larger presence of applied science and mission-oriented research, such as engineering and sustainability sciences. We provide examples of how this landscape can be used as a baseline to explore the specialisation of territories (regions), organisations (universities) and funding programmes.",

This research proposes a ‘Mineral Intelligence’ pipeline utilizing unsupervised machine learning to detect illicit mercury trafficking disguised as Electronic Waste (HS 8549). By applying Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Isolation Forest algorithms to UN Comtrade data (2020–2024), we identify a systemic ‘Balloon Effect’: as elemental mercury bans took effect in 2022, illicit volumes were structurally displaced into ‘fake waste’ classifications. Forensic analysis reveals a statistically significant ‘Smuggler’s Signature’ within these flows, characterized by a price anomaly of $24–$80/kg (mirroring liquid mercury markets) and a Net-to-Gross weight ratio exceeding 90%, physically corresponding to standard 34.5 kg steel mercury flasks. Furthermore, Node2Vec and spectral embedding analysis exposes a ‘Decoupling Chasm’ (Manifold Distance: 2.06) that topologically separates financial gold hubs from mercury-intensive mining zones. Finally, Recursive LSTM forecasts predict a ‘burnout’ of the current HS 8549 smuggling vector (-618M kg/yr), warning of an imminent regime shift toward chemically masked commodities.",

Objectives: This review sought to answer two questions: how concordant are patient-reported and routinely collected data on perinatal outcomes, and under what conditions is concordance higher or lower? Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. Study selection and data extraction: We included original research that reported on the concordance of patient-reported and routinely collected data for 11 International Consortium of Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) Pregnancy and Childbirth Standard Set outcomes and met other criteria. We used double independent title and abstract screening, full text review, and data extraction. Synthesis: We conducted a narrative synthesis, summarising study results both overall and by perinatal outcome, recall period for patient-reported data collection, data collection mode, and study timeframe. Results: Fourteen studies reported on 78 analyses of the concordance of patient-reported and routinely collected data across four outcomes: stillbirth, maternal length of stay, preterm birth, and oxygen dependence. They used a range of different metrics of concordance (e.g., percentage agreement, sensitivity, specificity) and reported perfect concordance of patient-reported and routinely collected data in some contexts but poor concordance in others. Conclusions: In some contexts, there may be greater methodological equivalence of patient-reported and routinely collected perinatal outcome data than is typically acknowledged. Further research is needed both on outcomes not yet studied and to systematically examine the methods, processes, and conditions that optimise accuracy and concordance of patient-reported and routinely collected perinatal outcome data.",

        "abstract": "Background To encourage transitions into employment or education, governments impose benefit sanctions on unemployed individuals who fail to comply with programme requirements. However, evidence on the effectiveness of such sanctions remains limited, particularly among young adults. We investigated whether sanctions are associated with transitions into employment or education and whether effects differ among individuals facing labour market disadvantages. To estimate causal effects using observational data, we applied a target trial emulation framework. Methods We used nationwide Finnish register data on 51,312 unemployed individuals under the age of 25 in 2022. Following a target trial emulation framework, we treated sanctions as the intervention and applied coarsened exact matching with importance weights to approximate random allocation. We constructed a labour market disadvantage score by summing five indicators associated with poorer labour market attachment. Time-to-event outcomes over a 24-month follow-up were estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods and parametric survival models. Results Overall, 78% of young adults transitioned to employment or education within an average of 10 months. With all sanctions, the median time to employment or education was slightly shorter for individuals who were sanctioned, with hazard ratios over 24 months. Among individuals without labour market disadvantages, sanctions were associated with a 2.7-month reduction in time to transition into employment or education. Among those with 3 to 5 labour market risks, the reduction was 0.1 months. Survival analyses supported the divergent associations among individuals with and without labour market disadvantages. Conclusions Unemployment benefit sanctions can facilitate transitions to employment or education among unemployed young adults without labour market disadvantages. However, the effects of sanctions differ between those with and without such disadvantages. Policymakers may use these findings to retarget sanctions or combine them with supportive measures.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Research on institutional dining interventions often emphasizes the promise of behavior-change strategies in shifting individuals toward healthier, more sustainable diets. While these solutions can be effective in shaping diner behavior, their potential to contribute to larger food systems transformation ultimately depends on how likely decision makers are to adopt and maintain them. With a focus on university foodservice, we explore the role of intervention acceptability in institutional-dining research by identifying the indicators used to measure it and examining how their incorporation within the literature aligns with the operational priorities of prospective implementers. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of 116 studies to identify the metrics used to measure the acceptability of institutional dining interventions. After arranging these metrics into themed indicator categories, we calculated the frequency with which individual indicators were reported and asked university-foodservice stakeholders to rank them based on their relative importance. Results: We identified eight indicators measuring changes in diner experience, dietary health, dietary sustainability, food prices, operating costs, staff satisfaction, institutional sustainability, and organizational culture. While most studies included some metric of intervention acceptability, reporting prevalence across indicators varied by theme, with more studies tracking changes in organizational culture than all other indicators combined. Reporting prevalence, however, was not predictive of how indicators were perceived by university-foodservice stakeholders, with seldom-reported themes, like diner experience, often being rated among the most important, and frequently reported themes, like organizational culture, often being rated among the least. Discussion: Efforts to align research with the goals of foodservice stakeholders are needed to scale sustainable dining interventions across institutions. Our findings demonstrate how the frameworks used to evaluate institutional dining interventions fail to represent the priorities of decision makers responsible for managing foodservice change. To accelerate the adoption of these solutions, institutional-dining research must move beyond assessments of dietary change alone and begin incorporating metrics that matter to prospective implementers.",

We conceptualise work exchange sharing accommodation as a reciprocity-oriented tourism form. Using social exchange theory, we investigate how perceived congruence and incongruence between travellers’ giving (labour) and taking (lodging and experiences) influence satisfaction. Analysing 193,707 traveller reviews, we find a non-linear satisfaction curve, peaking at moderate balance but declining when exchanges become excessive. Notably, travellers report higher satisfaction when receiving slightly more than they give. These insights deepen understanding of exchange dynamics in sharing economy tourism, highlight perceived fairness in host–traveller interactions, and offer practical implications for travellers, hosts, and platforms in promoting sharing economy tourism.",
