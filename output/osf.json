        "abstract": "Natural disasters span political boundaries, yet their devastating impacts vary widely across political jurisdictions. I argue that this is because of the differences in political incentives to uphold regulations concerning disaster preparedness. Turkey’s 2023 earthquake provides a rare empirical window to observe the cumulative effects of otherwise hidden political incentives. Leveraging the quasi-random shock of the earthquake, I employ a spatial regression discontinuity design along municipal boundaries in the earthquake region. I treat long-term party rule as the treatment and neighborhood-level destruction as the outcome. The analysis shows that neighborhoods governed by the same municipal party for more than 25 years experienced approximately 20\\% less destruction than their adjacent, politically contested counterparts. These findings translate into substantially lower exposure of hundreds of residents to known disaster risks. The results demonstrate that electoral competition without institutional brakes can deteriorate long-term policy outcomes. My paper underscores the importance of sharing accountability with technocratic oversight in policy areas requiring sustained infrastructural investment, such as disaster preparedness.",

        "abstract": "How do historical events—emergent, intense, and collectively experienced instances of political contingency—generate sweeping bursts of political engagement immediately after they occur? Rational choice perspectives see this capacity as stemming from how events perform as purveyors of information for citizens with exogenous and invariant political identities. Available cultural approaches, by contrast, contend that events politicize by changing the meanings people use to navigate political life. Different as they are, both perspectives assume that events’ politicizing impact remains contained within the domain of political experience. But, since politics is rarely instantiated in everyday life, they cannot fully adequately explain how events generate sweeping political activation. I offer an alternative “spillover” approach to understanding how events produce immediate politicization. I argue that the locus of this influence is located events’ ability to generate semantic disruptions that allow political narratives to infiltrate the stories and identities that guide social action within social domains that have more routinary instantiation. I develop this argument by drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in São Paulo in the wake of the unexpectedly strong victory of right-wing extremist Jair Bolsonaro in the first round 2018 Brazilian presidential election. My observations in public spaces and moments of sociability between left-leaning citizens portray this moment as one characterized by “politicization without politics”. Bolsonaro’s surprising electoral showing intensified feelings of vulnerability, prompting political perceptual and behavioral shifts that were rooted in personal rather than explicitly personal domains of social experience. These spillovers to the personal domain produced an environment of political “engagement without action” where visible political behavior drastically decreased and political conversations and interactions in intimate places skyrocketed.",

        "abstract": "Why does repression generate long-term resentment in some contexts but not others? Existing research focuses on how contemporary political context moderates the effects of repression; I emphasize factors that predated the repressive regime. I argue that prior socio-economic development shapes the legacies of political violence. In more developed areas, repression is harder to justify and more likely to provoke enduring backlash. Where development was limited, however, the promise of modernization may temper resentment. I explore two mechanisms – temporal comparisons and the role of education – and test the argument using novel census, archival, and survey data from Moldova. Combining historical records with contemporary public opinion surveys, I show that the relationship between Soviet-era repression and attitudes toward Moldova’s communist successor party varies systematically with prior development. These findings contribute to research on political violence by highlighting the importance of preexisting conditions in shaping long-term public responses to repression.",

        "abstract": "Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has increasingly used a “hybrid” strategy, supporting its conventional battlefield operations with irregular activities against Kyiv’s European supporters. At their forefront are low-cost and easily replaced “disposable agents” that provide Russia with considerable operational reach as well as plausible deniability. Using a new dataset of 127 disposable agents, this study combines descriptive and inferential statistics with social network analysis to exploratively examine their demographics, roles, deployment patterns, and organisational structure. Findings indicate that disposable agents are predominantly male, mid-thirties, drawn disproportionately from Ukrainian, Russian, Moldovan, and Bulgarian populations, and quite frequently re-used. Networks appear structurally hierarchical and compartmentalised, and seem designed with plausible deniability in mind. However, inconsistent operational security by GRU and FSB officers may have limited Russia’s ability to claim ignorance. The findings provide empirical insight into a covert and significant facet of Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy, informing both policy responses to an ongoing threat and further scholarship.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have established that abrupt and consequential periods of political uncertainty–or “eventful” times–impact political attitudes. But we still know little on whether events can affect political practices. I investigate how eventful times affect levels and socioeconomic status (SES) gaps in frequency of interpersonal political discussion, a consequential political practice and a high quality indicator of sustained political engagement. Drawing from citizen competence and social cognition studies, I hypothesize that events provoke political talk increases that will be moderate and unequalizing relative to SES for adults but large and equalizing for the young. I find empirical support for this expectation by evaluating differences between West Germany and France in political discussion changes before and during German Reunification. I develop and deploy an original quantitative indicator of eventfulness to show that this comparison meets difference-in-differences quasi-experimental conditions that tackles previously unaddressed validity issues related to history and ambiguous causal precedence.",

        "created": "2025-12-11",
        "abstract": "Abstract. Larger gaps in political engagement between individuals with high and low socioeconomic status (SES) are increasingly viewed as a threat to democratic quality. This paper investigates how such gaps in interpersonal political discussion have evolved in Western Europe over the last fifty years. While prior empirical work has often found these gaps to be stable, leading models of political behavior suggest they should have changed in response to rising economic inequality—though they differ on whether those changes were driven by increases or decreases in participation, and whether they were led by individuals at the top or bottom of the SES distribution. To evaluate these expectations, I analyze nearly one million survey responses from 843 Eurobarometer surveys conducted across 141 time points between 1973 and 2021. I find that SES gaps in political discussion followed an inverse quadratic trajectory: narrowing from the 1970s through the 1990s, and then widening again to levels comparable to those observed in the 1980s. Using Cross-Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) models, I identify economic inequality as the strongest predictor of this trend. Its effect, however, is negative—higher inequality is associated with narrower gaps in political discussion. The results also show that the evolution of these gaps was driven largely by shifts in political discussion among high-SES individuals, rather than disengagement among the less advantaged. Overall, the results do not suggest that economic inequality has driven increases in political discussion gaps. Instead, they point to the role that internet expansion and party fragmentation may have played in widening these gaps since the early 2000s.",

        "abstract": "Research shows that frontline workers often discriminate based on race or ethnicity. However, citizens can also display discriminatory behavior—for instance, by requesting service only from workers of the same ethnic or religious background. This discrimination exercised by citizens towards frontline employees remains underexplored. Drawing on studies of citizen–state interactions, discrimination, and political ideology, we investigate when the public finds such requests acceptable. Using a vignette survey experiment with 2,067 Danish citizens, we find that language-based requests are seen as more acceptable than those based on religion. Political ideology significantly shapes these views: right-leaning individuals are more accepting when the requester is from the ethnic majority, while left-leaning individuals are more accepting when the requester is from an ethnic minority. While these single-country findings may not generalize beyond one-to-one interactions characterized by high intimacy, they shed light on how ideology influences public attitudes toward ethnically motivated service preferences and highlight the need to further examine citizen-driven discrimination in public service settings.",

        "abstract": "This article investigates the role of gold in the transformation of the global financial and political order, focusing on its relationship with the U.S. dollar during periods of systemic crisis. It assesses whether gold or the dollar provides a more stable reserve asset by analyzing U.S. debt dynamics, BRICS gold accumulation, and recent digital monetary innovations. The study shows that the persistent rise of U.S. public debt, now exceeding $37 trillion, undermines confidence in the dollar’s sustainability despite its continuing dominance as the global reserve currency. In response, BRICS countries increasingly diversify reserves through gold holdings, a practice that functions not only as financial hedging but also as a political act of sovereignty against U.S. monetary coercion and sanctions. However, the absence of a coherent BRICS monetary strategy limits the bloc’s ability to offer a structured alternative to dollar hegemony. At the same time, the United States seeks to reinforce its monetary dominance through regulatory innovation, notably the GENIUS Act, which anchors stablecoins to the dollar. China, by contrast, promotes its digital renminbi (e-CNY) to gradually reduce reliance on dollar-based infrastructures. Together, these dynamics suggest a contested multipolar order where gold regains importance as a political and monetary anchor.",

        "abstract": "How do voting laws impact elections? We highlight how laws targeting a specific group of citizens can have weak effects on turnout and vote shares but substantial effects on policy platforms, thereby influencing substantive representation even if there are no observable effects on participation. To parse these effects, we analyze a model of electoral competition with endogenous turnout and targeted voting costs. Each party anticipates the direct effect of raising one side's voting costs: discouraging targeted citizens from voting. Consequently, both platforms shift towards the untargeted group. These platform adjustments mobilize targeted citizens and demobilize the untargeted, muting the net impact on turnout and vote shares—consistent with empirical evidence for small electoral effects. Policy effects, however, hurt targeted citizens and their aligned party. The targeted group's size amplifies these effects. Our results address party competition, participation, representation, and normative and empirical evaluations of voting laws.",

        "abstract": "On July 18, 2025, the United States enacted the GENIUS Act, the first federal statute to create a comprehensive regime for payment in stablecoins. This article argues that GENIUS operationalizes state power in digital monetary space and measurably strengthens U.S. financial sovereignty. It analyzes the Act’s core levers, a licensing monopoly over issuance and a three-year perimeter on exchange offerings; aligned categories of permitted issuers; reserves confined to cash, short-tenor Treasuries, AML (Anti Money Laundering) and sanctions obligations. The article links these mechanisms to four sovereignty channels: (i) increased structural demand for U.S. public debt, (ii) consolidation of rule-of-law control over on-chain dollars, (iii) extraterritorial standard-setting through reciprocity regimes, and (iv) policy signaling that legitimizes compliant dollar tokens. However, the Act’s limits are jurisdictional arbitrage, privacy and civil-liberties trade-offs, and dependence on macro credibility. The contribution reframes “monetary sovereignty” as concrete design features and proposes near-term indicators, reserves composition disclosures, treasury rulemaking on AML/sanctions and privacy, and reciprocity determinations for foreign regimes. GENIUS does not settle digital-dollar design, but it materially expands U.S. capacity to anchor private token markets in public money.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the theoretical tension between Goffman’s frontstage self-presentation and McAdams’s narrative identity theory, this study investigated if politicians’ public social media personas are strategic performances or reflect an internalized identity predicting backstage political behavior. We examined this authenticity paradox via U.S. legislators’ dissent voting, linking the language in 3.26 million tweets from 680 U.S. House Representatives (115th–118th Congresses) to 1.32 million roll-call votes. We used different natural language processing and network analysis techniques to measure narrative (agency, communion) and social identities (partisan interaction, structural holes) with fixed-effects panel models to observe that frontstage narratives predict backstage actions. Both agency and communion on Twitter were significantly associated with more dissent voting. Social identity, particularly higher inter-party interaction and spanning inter-party structural holes (lower Burt’s constraint), also positively predicted dissent. Mediation analysis confirmed social identity factors as key mechanisms linking narrative identity to dissent behavior. These findings suggest politicians’ self-narratives are public narratives that help to internalize an identity, shaping a self-concept that drives identity-congruent political action.",

        "abstract": "Communities around the world rely on networks of resource sharing to buffer households against hardship. Yet, under such informal insurance schemes, some needy families can be systematically left out. By modeling sharing and reputational spread on a network, we show how generosity can be sustained when reputational benefits spread across a community’s communication network, but also how network density and position shape who receives transfers---well-connected households become priority receivers due to their ability to spread givers' reputation more effectively. Our analysis, combining mathematical modeling with food sharing data from an Inuit community, reveals that communication network sparsity incentivizes broader sharing, but also more selectivity. The correlation of communication network structure and resource endowment is critical for stabilizing needs-based transfers. If need status does not perfectly (negatively) correlate with social influence, marginal households in need may still be excluded from sharing. By linking individual incentives to community-wide patterns, our framework clarifies when indirect reciprocity can stabilize outcomes that show the signatures of need-based transfers.",

        "abstract": "Inequality measures based on household surveys may be biased because they fail to capture the upper tail of the income distribution properly. The \"missing rich\" problem stems from sampling errors, item and unit nonresponse, underreporting of income, and data preprocessing techniques like top coding. This paper reviews salient approaches to address the underrepresentation of the rich in household surveys. Approaches are classified based on information sources and method. In terms of information sources, the distinction is between within-survey data and survey data combined with external sources (e.g., tax records). In terms of methods, we identify three categories: replacing, reweighting, and combined reweighting and replacing. We show that income inequality levels and trends are sensitive to the correction approach.

Influenced by social movement studies and transnational advocacy literature, this study conceptualizes such campaigns as digital boomerangs and provides an analytical framework for analyzing them. Further, with a novel computational analysis of all Iranian hashtag activism campaigns for global attention and news articles regarding Iran sourced from all over the world, I demonstrate that receiving international attention for such campaigns is rare but possible.

This paper, arising from an interdisciplinary team, is the first to explore the legal challenges posed by digital replicas set within the broad context of sociological and linguistic perspectives. Owing to the prevalence of AI digital voice replicas in the creative industries, we use qualitative focus group data to focus on the legal implications and potential impact of AI digital voice replicas within this domain. To do this, we draw on the views of researchers, creatives and IP practitioners. Our focus group findings illustrated a range of responses to AI and voice cloning including skepticism, uncertainty, and a sense of inevitability. We find that the loss of what many refer to as the ‘authentic voice’ through cloning evokes an emotional response. The voice means a lot to people. As AI evolves, we posit that authenticity as a concept itself may need reconceptualising. Against this backdrop, we highlight the urgent need to address the legal vulnerability of the “un-fixed” voice, (a voice not permanently captured in traditional recordings), and the inadequacy of current United Kingdom (UK) Intellectual Property (IP) frameworks to protect it, we find that those lacking such status remain largely unprotected, highlighting a significant regulatory lacuna. This shortfall calls for a more robust protection of a ‘personality right’ in UK law.",

        "abstract": "Class origin structures the conditions of early political learning, but parents’ political behaviour is the central channel through which class-based inequalities in participation are transmitted and reshaped over the life course. Using linked parent–child panel data from the BHPS and UKHLS (1995–2022), the study examines how class background and parental electoral participation during the formative years influence turnout from ages 18 to 40. Class-origin differences are largest at the start of adulthood but weaken, whereas exposure to parental voting has a stronger and more persistent influence on participation. The intergenerational transmission of participation is highly heterogeneous: differences by class origin persist only among those exposed to voting parents, while parental disengagement overrides between-class differences. Parental influence also varies by class contexts, remaining strongest among individuals from middle-class backgrounds. Class structures political socialization, but parents transmit, reinforce, or weaken class-linked norms, shaping the reproduction of inequality across generations.",

        "created": "2025-12-10",
        "abstract": "Social class analysis has been a vital component of sociologists’ research agenda for many decades, informing our understanding of social inequalities. However, current measures of social class are, by their neo-Weberian design determined by employment status and occupation. Consequently, measures of social class that are determined by employment relations restrict sociological understandings of social class to concepts related to working life. The study of later life – research that focuses upon the study of ageing and its impacts – typically focuses on individuals that have left the world of work and have entered a retired or semi-retired portion of their lives. To apply current measures of social class to the study of later life presents several challenges. Sociologists are often forced to use a ‘legacy’ class measure that uses an individual’s last recorded occupation prior to retiring. This is problematic, as legacy occupation may not reflect an individual’s current social class location. This paper seeks to remedy these problems by adopting a Bourdieusian inspired framework based on Capitals, Assets, and Resources (CAR) to construct a relevant social class measure for the study of later life. First, we set a theoretical foundation for the construction of this new measure of social class in later life. Then, using multiple correspondence analysis and latent profile analysis, we identified a five-class model of social class for use in later life. Our five-class model constitutes a small but very privileged Elite; followed by an established middle and culturally engaged high earners which make up a decently sized middle class; most respondents fall into a traditional working class with the rest making up a sizeable precariat class. We find a stark composition of social class membership characterised by a sizeable Traditional Working Class and a large Precariat population with a small middle class and tiny but exceptionally privileged Elite. Our findings from formal statistical modelling on determinants of security, stability, and prospects in later life demonstrate that CAR based approaches present clear points of stratification across social classes. This clarity is possible without having to rely on legacy based measures that are tied to forms of employment relations. We also find evidence to support the use of both legacy and CAR based measures of social class in the analysis of later life.",

But a key assumption for hypothesis testing via significance is not met: the data are not taken from a random sample. When we consider the size of the effects revealed by their analysis (which consists of the latest techniques for analyzing panel data), a different and arguably more compelling interpretation is that adoption of right-to-work laws did lead to an increase in the rate of occupational fatalities, an increase even greater than was suggested in earlier research.",

        "abstract": "Predatory publishing – for-profit academic publishers and journals publishing academic articles with inadequate quality control – is a professional and societal problem in modern science. Due to their illegitimacy and unprofessionalism, predatory publishers and journals are seldom indexed by major journal bibliographic indices, such as Scopus or the Web of Science. This lack of indexed metadata makes analyzing the predatory publishing market difficult. To fill this gap, we collected journal metadata of corpuses of six probable predatory publishers, comprised of 310,924 articles. We also collected metadata of four other publishers of higher – but contested – legitimacy, to compare with metadata of 54 million articles indexed in the Web of Science. Our research pinpoints precise geographic, institutional and disciplinary sites where probable predatory publishing occurs. Scholars affiliated with developing countries and lower-status institutions disproportionately publish in probable predatory journals. However, since academically central countries and high-status institutions are prolific publishers, they provide much of the money and articles that support the predatory publishing market, even if predatory publishing is a proportionately smaller problem in privileged institutions. Predatory publishing is a worldwide problem, with varying niches and consequences in different institutions and countries. Inequalities in resources and scientific reward structures influence intellectual choices of scholars throughout the world, including propensities for knowingly or naively publishing articles in predatory journals. Research integrity is an emerging axis of stratification in contemporary science.",

This article takes a different perspective, applying ideas from an ecological approach to culture to social media informational dynamics. It argues that success online depends both on the intrinsic appeal of content to receivers and on how well content serves producers’ strategic goals within the constraints and affordances of specific platforms. These goals include reputation management, coalition building and identity management, and coordination or participation in shared activities. Transmission is often a by-product of these motivations, and replication fidelity plays a limited role compared with transformations that adapt content to local incentives. Finally, the article suggests that platforms and communities can be understood as distinct ecological niches, each characterised by different audience structures, affordances, metrics, and algorithmic pressures. This perspective offers novel insight to persistent debates on social media dynamics, such as misinformation, radicalisation and polarisation, and the reasons behind online success.",

Persistent hardship, disadvantage and discrimination - amid omnipresent policy initiatives aimed at combating them - exacerbate these dilemmas and are a perennial source of workplace tension. Frequently these tensions escalate to the point of unworkability among those tasked with collaborating in the interests of the community. Under the guise of accountability or advocacy of justice, and backed by the (perceived) power of the state, conflict among practitioners often leads to factionalism, standoffs and can escalate to bullying, harassment, violence and lawsuits. This article proposes a simple heuristic for ethical deliberation among those working in remote Indigenous community governance. Drawing on deontological and consequentialist ethics, as well as the policy literature, it provides a framework to structure conversations on ethics in decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Humans are uniquely capable of reaching consensus within large, hierarchically structured societies. Yet the pathways by which consensus emerges, especially under constraints imposed by social organization, remain poorly understood. We use agent-based modeling to explore how marriage structure, social group nesting, and decision-making norms can shape a group’s ability to reach consensus. In our model, simulated agents are embedded in multilevel social networks and possess noisy information. Decisions are spread via three different cascades using one of several interaction norms. We find that family formation via marriages, especially when clustered within kin units, impedes consensus by slowing the rate of information diffusion and elevating informational entropy. In contrast, increasing the size of nested subgroups in a multilevel network reduces category overlap and promotes consensus. Finally, decision-making norms that bypass early-stage clustering through the formation of coalitions or representative bodies lead to faster group decisions. These results offer insights into how consensus dynamics are shaped by social structure and provide a theoretical bridge between research on network topology, collective intelligence, and human social evolution.",

The study also considers the role of evolving local opportunity structures, such as the expansion of polytechnics in the 1990s, which may benefit those who remain in place. Our findings indicate that stable, persistent exposure to improved opportunity structures throughout childhood is more consistently associated with higher probabilities of completing higher education by age 30 than is mobility toward such opportunities, with parental separation and parental unemployment compounding the disadvantages associated with mobility.

In this study, we investigate whether women have an educational advantage when raised in hypogamous (the mother is more educated than the father) rather than hypergamous families (the father is the more educated parent), whether men experience a similar advantage when raised in hypergamous rather than hypogamous families, and whether these advantages vary with the prevalence of hypogamous families relative to hypergamous ones. We use data from four waves of the European Union Statistics and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey, yielding a sample of 50,746 individuals residing in 28 European countries and born between 1956 and 1995. Our results show that women benefit from being raised in hypogamous families, a positive effect on their educational attainment that did not diminish as hypogamy became more prevalent relative to hypergamy. Men from hypergamous families experience a similar advantage, but this effect waned as hypergamy declined relative to hypogamy.

Amidst evolving Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) regulations, social sustainability has gained academic attention. While there is a growing recognition that labour conditions within tourism require improvements to sustain the industry and support the workforce within it, labour-centred social sustainability and the role of unions have received limited consideration to date, despite their important role in protecting decent work and workers’ rights. Based on semi-structured interviews with global union leaders and affiliates, and underpinned by Institutional Theory, this paper proposes a framework that shows how unions shift from a traditional union paradigm towards social-sustainability-oriented unionism. During this process, labour unions engage and intervene at various levels in tourism, mobilising normative claims, shaping regulatory structures and reframing cognitive-cultural understandings. This research argues that unions should be equal and strategic partners of tourism stakeholders to implement robust labour-centred social sustainability practices and policies to achieve improved tourism labour conditions, improved business outcomes and wider social sustainability. As ESG regulations come into force and severe labour shortages continue, the paper offers timely insight and guidance on how to improve mandatory social sustainability efforts and attract and retain talent.",

        "created": "2025-12-13",
        "abstract": "The study of cognitive biases has dominated behavioral economics and cognitive psychology for nearly half a century, proposing a view of human cognition as systematically flawed. This chapter presents a fundamental reconceptualization of cognitive biases through the lens of ecological rationality and developmental plasticity. Building on Oeberst and Imhoff's (2023) insight that many biases reflect belief-consistent information processing, we argue that these phenomena may be better understood as instances of adaptive mismatch—situations where cognitive strategies that were adaptive in their original environmental context produce suboptimal results when applied in novel environments. Rather than viewing these mismatches as products of fixed, evolutionarily-designed modules, we propose that they emerge from the flexible reassembly of basic cognitive capabilities through cultural learning processes, as suggested by the cognitive gadgets approach. This framework integrates several theoretical perspectives: the reconceptualization of decision-making as continuous environmental navigation rather than discrete choice; understanding cognitive strategies as ecologically rational adaptations to environmental structure; viewing mismatches as informative signals within a vector field of potential adaptations; and analyzing heuristics through the lens of predictive processing. We provide concrete examples from empirical research that demonstrate how seemingly irrational behaviors can be understood as adaptive responses to specific environmental structures. Our synthesis offers a theoretical integration across multiple research traditions while suggesting new approaches to research methodology and policy intervention. This ecological perspective not only provides a more nuanced account of why cognitive \"biases\" persist but also suggests more effective approaches to education, decision support, and public policy that work with, rather than against, the ecological design of human cognition.",

        "abstract": "This paper evaluates the structural, environmental, and climatic factors influencing carbon dioxide emissions from the building sector (CBE) in 27 European Union member states from 2005 to 2023. This analysis uses panel data from the World Bank and four econometric models—Random Effects, Fixed Effects, Dynamic Panel GMM, and Weighted Least Squares—coupled with machine learning and clustering to provide a robust analysis of emissions. The econometric models show that all models support a negative relationship between agriculture, forestry, and fishing value added (AFFV) and forest area (FRST), suggesting that a robust rural economy and substantial natural carbon sinks are accompanied by lower emissions in the building sector. On the other hand, water stress (WSTR), PM2.5 pollution, heating and cooling degree days, and nitrous oxide emissions (N2OP) are found to significantly, yet positively, affect CBE. Tests of diagnostic analyses support Fixed Effects and Weighted Least Squares models, whereas results from GMM models are limited by instrument validity violations. In machine learning analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models are found to be most diagnostic, with all performance metrics being improved, establishing a prominent role for coal electricity, water stress, agricultural intensities, and climatic factors. Subsequently, a solution with 10 clusters, selected using Bayesian Information Criteria and silhouettes, identified a set of environmental and economic characteristics based on differences between low- and high-emission groups. High-emitting groups result from agricultural intensification, pollution, and low energy efficiency, while low-emitting groups are associated with renewable energy, low pollution, and a favorable climate. This analysis, hence, presents a multifaceted assessment of building sector emissions, with climatic, structural, and energy transition patterns as driving factors for meeting decarbonization targets for the European Union.",

        "abstract": "Background: Communication partners are crucial for adults with severe learning disabilities, as they recognise, interpret, and respond to non-verbal cues while sharing responsibility for creating a meaningful two-way communication process. Evidence-based strategies such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) can enhance interactions; however, their implementation in social care settings is inconsistent, constrained by workforce, organisational, and systemic barriers. This study–which forms part of the Improving Communication with Adults with Learning Disabilities (ICALD) programme–aimed to identify stakeholder-perceived barriers and facilitators to good communication support and to co-develop a Theory of Change (ToC) to guide implementation improvements in social care settings. Methods: Forty-eight stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, including adults with learning disabilities, participated in a total of 15 ToC workshops, one focus group, two interviews, and four supported conversations. Template Analysis based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to identify core themes, barriers, and facilitators across CFIR domains. These key findings informed the iterative, collaborative development of the ToC map. Results: Implementation barriers and facilitators identified across the CFIR domains indicated individual-, organisational-, and system-level factors influencing communication support. Key barriers included limited access to specialist professionals, inconsistent training, fragmented information-sharing systems, and variable staff knowledge of communication needs. Facilitators included strong leadership commitment, collaborative working with speech and language therapists and family carers, and peer mentoring. Supported conversations highlighted the importance of staff responsiveness to non-verbal cues. The resulting ToC map outlines short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes through three core pathways: 1) collaborative development of resources and training, 2) improved information sharing and recording, and 3) ongoing skills development, coaching, and supervision. Conclusions: Improving the implementation of good communication support for adults with severe learning disabilities is likely to depend on organisational commitment, leadership engagement, and structured workforce development supported by specialist input. The ToC developed provides a theoretically grounded framework for translating known facilitators into practical, context-specific strategies. It highlights the necessity of capacity-building within teams and organisational alignment with the communication rights of adults with severe learning disabilities to achieve sustainable, consistent and effective practice change.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the factors influencing college enrollment outcomes is critical for reducing melt. This exploratory pilot study examines demographic, behavioral, and intersectional predictors of summer melt among incoming first-year and transfer students at a large Southern California university. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed survey responses (N = 1,679), text message engagement, and post-orientation workshop observations. Among the students who participated in the survey, only 1.85% experienced melt. Of the survey participants, 467 agreed to be contacted via text, email, or Zoom for continued post-orientation engagement, and the melt rate for contacted students was 1.93%. On the other hand, the institutional melt rate for all first-year students for that academic term was 21%. Non-resident students exhibited significantly higher melt rates, while first-generation status and race/ethnicity did not significantly predict melt. Behavioral factors such as cannabis use correlated with increased melt likelihood, while self-reported social engagement and financial concerns did not reach statistical significance. Qualitative findings revealed substantial student interest in mental health services, academic support, and logistical guidance, with transfer students expressing increased concerns about social integration. These findings underscore the importance of pre-matriculation support, tailored interventions for non-resident students, and proactive engagement to inform about financial and mental health resources.",

        "abstract": "The two most notable Asian giants of the century are China and India. China's rapid ascent in South Asian nations in recent years has alarmed India’s dominance. Bangladesh is a sought-after partner for China due to its strategic location in the Bay of Bengal. Previously, India seemed to have a significant amount of control over Bangladesh. However, India's long-standing concerns about its power over Bangladesh have gradually been eroded by China's growing influence in the political, military, economic, and infrastructure spheres. The paper demonstrates the degree to which China has already surpassed India in Bangladesh's key industries. It also determines if China's increasing influence in Bangladesh is weakening India’s image in South Asia by examining regional ramifications, repercussions for Bangladesh's foreign policy, and India-Bangladesh relations.",

The findings of the study revealed that person deixis functioned as assertiveness and personal responsibility, spatial deixis served as scope of governance, time deixis performed the function of historical milestones and future commitments, discourse deixis signified references and transitions and social deixis expressed interpersonal relationships in the selected speeches respectively. The study concluded that, inaugural speeches primarily served as a platform for governors to convey gratitude, affirm their responsibilities, and strengthen social connections with the citizens.",

        "abstract": "Against a backdrop of increasingly frequent external shocks and deepening cross-sectoral coupling, traditional national risk assessments centred on ‘industry/sector’ units often struggle to explain why seemingly localised disturbances rapidly evolve into systemic instability. This paper proposes an integrated ‘Dependency Network–Knowledge Graph (DN-KG)’ framework tailored for intelligence research and academic discourse. This framework abstracts Cambodia's macroeconomic, financial, real estate, fuel and power supply, border security, climate agriculture, tourism services, and governance regulatory systems into node sets. It integrates cross-system constraints and operationalises the DN-KG framework to: DN-KG)‘ framework for intelligence research and academic discourse. This framework abstracts Cambodia's macroeconomic, financial, real estate, fuel and power supply, border security, climate-agriculture, tourism services, and governance-regulation sectors into node sets, while cross-system constraints and transmission relationships are abstracted into edge sets. ’High-betweenness dependency edges\" serve as the core indicator for identifying systemic vulnerabilities. Building upon verifiable OSINT data, this paper constructs a reproducible node-edge inventory and cascade mechanism model. This enables evidence-anchored causal chain interpretation and scenario simulation for short-term trigger points (fuel channels and supply chains), medium-term structural vulnerabilities (US export concentration—employment—household debt—financial asset quality), and risk amplifiers (property correction—collateral — non-performing exposures—credit supply contraction). Research indicates that Cambodia's most critical vulnerability lies not in the weakness of any single sector, but in the cascading structure formed by the combined effects of ‘disruptability × cross-sector spillover × recovery difficulty’ along a few high-degree dependency edges. Therefore, resilience-building priorities should shift from ‘sectoral blood transfusions’ to ‘alternative pathways for critical dependency edges, inventory buffers, and institutional stabilisers’. Furthermore, strictly refraining from providing operational coordination or violence optimisation recommendations, this paper proposes a ‘compliant, auditable, reversible, humanitarian exception’ economic action portfolio for Thailand to adopt in the context of conflict spillover. This aims to reduce regional systemic risk and create conditions for de-escalation negotiations.",

However, systematic data to study longitudinal dynamics of issue-based affective polarization, in addition to partisan divides, remains scarce, especially in the context of multi-party systems. To address this, we introduce the Berlin Polarization Monitor, a 15-wave panel survey running from 2025 to 2027 on partisan and issue-based polarization, emotions, political behavior, personality traits, and well-being in Germany. It covers a wide range of issue-related polarization, including asylum policy, climate change, cordon sanitaire, as well as multiple dimensions of economic and social policy. Feeling thermometers for partisan- and issue-based groups are complemented by precise measures of discrete emotions. This enables the validation of thermometer scores, as well as the study of the emotional foundations of political conflicts and a wide range of related outcomes, including collective action, trust, and coping strategies. Its longitudinal design allows examining within-person changes in polarization and the effects of politically salient events such as elections and crises. The study period includes the 2025 federal election and several regional elections. Overall, the Berlin Polarization Monitor provides a innovative research infrastructure borne out of interdisciplinary collaboration, with particular relevance for political science, psychology, and sociology.",

This study investigates how the Dutch public evaluates such trade-offs in the context of a potential outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) administered to a representative sample of 1,045 respondents from the LISS panel, we examined preferences across six policy outcomes: mortality, lasting physical and mental injuries, postponed healthcare, social restrictions, and one-off tax payments. A latent class logit model identified four distinct preference profiles, revealing substantial heterogeneity in moral and economic reasoning. Two classes exhibited taboo trade-off aversion (TTOA) when values such as life or human dignity were traded against monetary costs. Respondents displaying TTOA emphasized solidarity and governmental responsibility, while cost-sensitive groups prioritized economic efficiency. These findings highlight that public acceptance of pandemic policies depends not only on effectiveness and cost but also on perceived moral legitimacy. Accounting for TTOA in economic evaluation can improve the ethical considerations and societal acceptability of future pandemic preparedness strategies.",

Using existing literature, the study shows how contested identities, cultural stereotypes, and social stigma marginalize this set of people across family, community, and societal levels. While people are generally innocent at birth, society still has a way of marginalizing people based on the circumstances of birth. Using Nussbaum’s ten capabilities, this study understands that people born of genocidal rape in Rwanda have diminished capabilities as compared to the majority of society. Such impaired capabilities reinforce social exclusion, which further plunges the victims into a cycle of cultural, political, social, economic, and psychological marginalization. The paper submits that the social exclusion of people born of genocidal rape constitutes social injustice and advocates for the dismantling of cultural barriers to enable the full participation of such individuals in the Rwandan society.",

        "abstract": "Indonesia, the world’s largest palm-oil producer, has undergone extensive forest conversion over the past two decades through forest-release policies and plantation licensing, particularly in Sumatra and Kalimantan. These land-use changes have degraded watershed buffering capacity and increased the frequency and severity of hydrological disasters for downstream communities. Yet such transformations are routinely obscured by political narratives that present palm oil as a green, pro-poor, and sovereign commodity, while dismissing concerns over deforestation as biased or misleading. Recent presidential claims that “palm oil is just trees that absorb CO₂” exemplify an emerging post-truth environmental discourse that equates plantations with forests and weakens climate commitments. This article develops a political-ecology analysis of Indonesia’s palm-oil–disaster nexus by bringing together three conceptual lenses: (1) the political ecology of commodity frontiers and forest governance; (2) post-truth environmental politics and the strategic denial of ecological harm; and (3) disaster populism and crisis-time “governance by spectacle.” Drawing on validated secondary evidence on deforestation, licensing decisions, watershed degradation, and major flood events, complemented by NGO investigations, media reporting, and selected policy documents, the article employs a within-case interpretive design combining process tracing and discourse analysis. We show how state–business coalitions facilitating forest conversion are legitimised through post-truth narratives, and how subsequent flood disasters become stages for personalised, mediatised food-aid spectacles that reinforce elite legitimacy while diverting attention from structural drivers of vulnerability. These findings suggest that Indonesia’s climate and disaster governance is increasingly organised around symbolic relief and denial rather than risk reduction and justice. Policy implications include re-evaluating forest-release permits in high-risk watersheds, clarifying legal definitions of “forest” versus “plantation,” improving data transparency, and de-personalising disaster relief within rights-based frameworks.",

We conducted a two-stage mixed methods study that combined digital lab measures (eye tracking, facial expression analysis, and galvanic skin response) with projective interviews. Seventy UK participants viewed three pairs of hotel messages encouraging water conservation, energy saving and recycling, and food-waste reduction, each varying in clarity and tone. Physiological data showed that participants attended closely to all messages but displayed little variation in emotional intensity, while projective interviews revealed how they reflected on and interpreted these emotional responses. Clear and empowering messages evoked warmth, pride, and trust, which strengthened behavioural intention. Constructed emotional resonance, rather than arousal intensity, drove pro-environmental intention.",

To ensure that evidence-based scales are used for this purpose, comprehensive and transparent reporting of measurement properties is a first essential step. This study aimed to evaluate the reporting quality of studies that applied Rasch analysis on scales designed to measure well-being or QoL in older persons. Articles employing Rasch analysis were identified through a previous broader systematic review of psychometric studies. The findings demonstrate notable deficiencies in the reporting of measurement properties, indicating substantial room for improvement. While detailed reporting alone cannot guarantee that scales possess satisfactory measurement quality, it constitutes a necessary prerequisite for drawing evidence-based conclusions about their measurement quality. Improved reporting practices are essential not only for enhancing the interpretability and replicability of individual studies but also for enabling informed decisions in clinical and policy contexts regarding the use of well-being and QoL scales for older populations.",

        "abstract": "The protest paradigm has been a central concept in research on media and social movements, documenting systematic patterns of protest marginalization through emphasis on violence, disruption, and official authority. Yet existing studies vary in how they operationalize the paradigm, raising a critical empirical question: do measures designed to capture media attention, the selection and salience of textual elements, converge with measures designed to capture framing, the interpretive structures that construct meaning? This study disentangles these dimensions by comparing two computational approaches: (1) document-level frame identification using a generative large language model (LLM), producing both content and framing scores, and (2) a sentence-level classifier to identify the same categories and aggregated via article structure and attention metrics into a weighted composite measure at the document level. Using news wire data from Latin America and Southern Europe (2000–2025), we examine nine protest-paradigm categories. Results reveal strong convergence for lexically concrete, recurrent frames (e.g., Violence, Law and Order, Decay of Morals) and weak or inconsistent alignment for interpretive or context-dependent frames (e.g., Troublemakers, Nuisance, Righteous Struggle). These findings highlight systematic methodological differences: LLMs capture implicit, cross-sentence framing, while sentence-level classifiers can validate only structurally explicit frames. The study underscores the importance of transparent aggregation procedures and human validation, and demonstrates that conclusions about protest coverage, media bias, and framing are contingent on the operationalization employed. By clarifying the boundary between attention and framing, this research contributes both to computational media analysis and to the conceptual refinement of the protest paradigm.",

The chapter argues that while mainstream media can enhance public understanding and counter misinformation, they are equally capable of amplifying fear and politicization. Using qualitative data from news texts, journalist interviews, and audience focus groups, the discussion shows how news values, moralization, and political rivalry transformed a scientific issue into a public scandal.

The PH rides occur weekly and bear titles such as \"Central Contour of the 1929 Flood,\" \"Mouth of the Meninos to the Mouth of the Zavuvus,\" \"Dry Valleys of the Tietê from Remédios to Osasco,\" and \"Going Uberaba Upstream and Descending Cupecê with a Desmorrodouro in the Middle,\" among others. Participants move in varied directions, contributing to the construction of a collective memory around the mosaics of landscapes, anomalies, and rivers in a city that many insist is shapeless, ugly, and dirty, but which reveals itself as a witness to a complex labyrinth where humanity and nature are indistinguishable. From its inception on September 9,2024, to November 12, 2025, the PH led 237 people to traverse 71 distinct routes, delivering a total of 324,186 kilojoules of movement energy to perceive the watercourses. This amount of energy is equivalent to 8 liters of gasoline, although covering the same distance with a motor vehicle would require 2,290 liters of gasoline.It is empirically demonstrated that the bicycle uses 286 times less energy per kilometer than a car to move within the urban site of São Paulo when choosing to pedal along paths that were once obvious but have been buried, obstructed, or erased as possible ways.",

It adds further approaches that became influential in our understanding of scientific cultures, like Becher’s (1989) investigation of ‘academic tribes and territories’, higher education research into campus cultures and academic socialisation processes or Lave and Wenger’s work on ‘communities of practice’ (Lave and Wenger 1991, Wenger 1999). This first part of the ‘Rahmenschrift’ ends with an overview of current scholarly discussions that focus on reconstructions of and critical reflections on change in epistemic cultures. In the second part of the Rahmenschrift, I introduce my own engagement with the concept of epistemic cultures that goes back to my PhD project on disciplinary socialisation processes. I then move on to outline my reconstruction of ‘cultures of non-knowledge’ within expert controversies and explain how this research ignited my interest in more-than-epistemic cultures, namely techno-epistemic cultures and post-normal scientific cultures. In a short third part, I summarise the aspects that I see the most central for further developing our understanding of epistemic cultures and for applying this understanding to open questions in science and society.",

        "abstract": "Recent discoveries in Malta and Tunisia provocatively point to a possible web of Mesolithic/Epipalaeolithic sea crossings, encounters, and exchanges that linked continents long before the age of the sail (Lipson et al. 2025; Scerri et al 2025). Determining whether such connections were singular events or sustained episodes is therefore critical to illuminate the scale of early seafaring. Here, we model how patterns of sea-level change impacted land connectivity between Sicily and Malta and predict potential population sizes through time from the Last Glacial Maximum to evaluate whether Mesolithic hunter-gatherers could have persisted on Malta, or if sustained connections would have been required. To achieve this, we use reconstructions of sea-level change and modern bathymetric models to evaluate changes in land size areas and connectivity. We calculate Net Primary Productivity values for a high-resolution palaeoclimate dataset, which we translate to population density by comparisons to ethnographic datasets. Finally, we calculate changes in estimated population sizes through time for Malta and Sicily, as well as minimum distances of sea voyages. Our results show that following disconnection from Sicily, Malta would have been unsuitable to support a viable, persistent forager population, including for the minimum 1000-year timespan of the Maltese Mesolithic record. As a result, only repeated, long-distance sea voyaging can explain the longevity of Mesolithic occupations of Malta, opening up the possibility that other south-central Mediterranean islands were reached and explaining the presence of European hunter-gatherer ancestry in North Africa.",

        "abstract": "In modern Indian and Western cultures, the focus is mostly on the physical health and fitness of future generations, rather than mental, spiritual, emotional, and moral values. Due to this ignorance, the upcoming generation is becoming directionless and deprived of emotional and moral values; and is getting involved in different kinds of misconduct. The founder / patron of All World Gayatri Pariwar, Yug Rishi Pt. Shriram Sharma Acharya ji has stated several methodologies in his literature for the development of the future generation. He directed that the decline in humanistic and moral values in children, and the downfall of society, culture, and morality starts in the womb of the mother. The foundation of the personality (body and mind) of a child is laid in the womb of a mother. So, this knowledge, based on evidence and scientific findings, should be spread to the masses, not only for the development of an individual or family, but also for the interest of the nation and the world. This will help in the development of a civilized, cultured, and virtuous future generation. All such inspiring efforts for the emotional and spiritual development of future generations are combined under a systematic movement known as the “Aao Gadhe Sanskarwan Peedhi” program. This research paper depicts one such case study of ‘Gharbhotsav Sanskar’ under the movement “Aao Gadhe Sanskarwan Peedhi”, in which the effect of basic teachings of ancient Indian culture on the developmental milestones of a new-born child have been studied. Several developmental milestones of the child, up to the age of 2 years, happened much earlier (were preponed) as compared to the standard developmental milestones, illustrating the effectiveness of the above methodology in the creation of an advanced offspring as compared to its normal peers. The results clearly depict the effectiveness of the basic elements of the ancient Indian culture, with regards to the creation of an advanced future generation.",

        "abstract": "This pilot study addresses the current lack of systematic, large-scale evidence on Open Science Practices (OSPs) adoption in criminology and legal psychology. A scalable, machine-learning-based text classification pipeline is introduced to map the prevalence of Open Access (OA), Open Data (OD), Open Materials (OM), and Preregistration (PR). The analysis is based on publication metadata and a year-stratified sample of full texts from the top 100 journals in Criminology &amp; Penology, Law, and Psychology (2013-2023). After identifying articles containing statistical inference (SI) via a high-performing classifier, the author utilized GPT-assisted coding and supervised learning to train specific classifiers for OD, OM, and PR. OA was classified using publicly available metadata. Among 1,763 SI articles with usable full text, design-based estimates reveal a significant disparity in OSP adoption. OA is relatively common (40.9%, 95% CI: 38.8-43.1) and has steadily increased from approximately 20% in 2013 to 50% in 2023. By sharp contrast, trends for OD, OM, and PR cannot be reliably quantified. Extreme class imbalance and the minimal number of positive cases indicate a very low underlying true prevalence for these practices in the assessed field. Methodologically, the study confirms that GPT-assisted coding supports accurate SI detection, but robust prevalence estimation for extremely low-frequency OSPs remains challenging for downstream classifiers. Overall, this project establishes a transparent and reproducible pipeline and provides critical baseline estimates for future, larger-scale assessments of research transparency in crime-related fields.",

Recent efforts attempt to reframe neglect as a consequence of ecologically layered disadvantages or “overload.” However, it is unclear if this ecological focus is reflected in the research base backing neglect interventions. In this study we systematically reviewed articles describing interventions labeled as evidence-based and as targeting neglect, finding that few (11%; n = 5) addressed neglect as a distinct maltreatment type. Among these five articles, we documented the populations targeted by the interventions, along with the theoretical frameworks used. By identifying which participants researchers engaged and which contributing factors measured, we shed light on the underlying, often unnamed, theoretical models that currently inform evidence-based interventions. We highlight a stark divide between the recent framing of neglect as an outcome of ecological disadvantages and an evidence base for neglect interventions focused primarily on parental failures.

        "abstract": "Bayesian phylogenetics has become a standard tool in historical linguistics, and for the most part implements models borrowed from evolutionary biology. Not enough work has been done to validate the analysis set-up that has become standardised in phylolinguistics, which consists of binary data with ascertainment bias, data partitions with correlated site number and rate, the binary covarion substitution model, and the uncorrelated lognormal branch rate model. Here I perform a set of simulation-based calibration studies to test a typical phylolinguistic analysis in the software BEAST2. Although the analysis can correctly recover the parameters of the substitution model, complications arise due to the combination of ascertainment bias and partitions of unequal length and rate. Reweighting the partition-specific rates by the number of sites, as is the default behaviour, leads to poorly calibrated posteriors. An alternative approach, where each meaning is assumed to come from an alignment of equal length, behaves correctly in simulations and is found to fit better to empirical data. I also assess the adequacy of the covarion substitution model through posterior predictive simulations. The covarion is found to fall short of approximating the true process of lexical evolution, likely due to the prevalence of semantic shift and the non-independence of cognate substitutions in real data. This work highlights the importance of thorough testing of models and their implementation in phylolinguistics, as well as the need for further research on improving models of lexical evolution.",

        "abstract": "Digitalisation has transformed public transport services worldwide, yet disparities in access, skills, and outcomes continue to reinforce a digital divide in how citizens engage with these services. While previous studies have examined the digital divide in internet use and smart technologies, few have explored how these inequalities manifest in everyday interactions with digital public transport platforms. To this end, we investigated user experiences of public transport applications in Birmingham, whose digital inclusion is disproportionate to its status as a major urban and economic hub in the UK, by analysing 4,275 user reviews on public transport services collected from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store between 2016 and 2025. Using a mixed natural language processing (NLP) approach combining topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we identified key themes and emotional tones in user feedback. Results revealed three dominant topics: App Performance, Usability, and Service Satisfaction, each corresponding to the access, ability, and motivation dimensions of the digital divide. Sentiment analysis showed generally negative evaluations, particularly around technical access barriers and satisfaction issues. By integrating user-generated data with digital divide theory, these results provide novel empirical evidence of how inequalities in digital engagement persist within digital twin planning and smart city transport systems, and highlight the importance of inclusive digital design for equitable and sustainable mobility access.",

        "created": "2025-12-15",
        "abstract": "Background: The structure of causes of death has changed in low-mortality countries, with recent trends showing increasing cause diversity. However, most research overlooks that several conditions often contribute to the process leading to death. Objective: This paper develops a framework for studying cause-of-death diversity that accounts for multiple causes of death (MCoD). Methods: We introduce novel MCoD life tables to estimate cause diversity based on age-standardized metrics. Two dimensions of diversity are assessed: the average number of causes contributing to death and how diverse are these causes. For the latter dimension, two indexes derived from the Gini-Simpson index are proposed, each based on a different perception of the role of the contributing causes in the process leading to death. All metrics are decomposable and applied to data from Denmark, France, Spain and the U.S. Results: The results show increased cause diversity, both in terms of the average number of causes and how evenly deaths are distributed across groups of causes. MCoD yields higher diversity than the underlying causes of death (UCD), confirming that relying solely on UCD downplays the complexity of the mortality process. However, the increase over time in diversity is more modest when using MCoD compared to UCD. The main driver of increasing cause diversity is the decline in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system. Contribution: This study offers a novel framework for analyzing cause diversity using MCoD. The proposed metrics are intuitive, life-table-based, and provide valuable insights into the growing complexity of the mortality process across countries.",

        "abstract": "Traditional management frameworks remain structurally aligned with neurotypical norms, rendering neurodivergent talent underutilized and excluded by design. This paper introduces a neurodiversity-native theory of management that redefines cognitive variance not as a challenge to be accommodated, but as a core system property to be architected for. We argue that \"inclusion\" frameworks, while well-intentioned, function as retrofits to inherently exclusionary systems and fail to unlock the full potential of heterogeneous cognition. Drawing on interdisciplinary research across cognitive science, organizational theory, and critical disability studies, we propose a paradigm shift: Neuromanagement by Default (NbD). This model replaces compliance-driven accommodation with participatory design principles, modular work systems, and leadership practices grounded in cognitive pluralism. We synthesize emerging evidence that shows how reimagining work environments to center neurodivergence fosters innovation, resilience, and collective intelligence. Rather than assimilating difference into dominant norms, NbD designs for difference from the outset. The paper concludes with a call to reengineer the epistemology of management itself, treating neurodiversity not as a demographic feature, but as the infrastructure of organizational adaptability in a complex world.",

The mostly linear approaches such as represented in the current agricultural discourses and by the agricultural sciences fall short in explaining the real-life complexities and overlapping crises experienced by small-scale farmers. Based on my recent qualitative fieldwork in Thailand, this paper aims to picture the complexities within which households' farming practices operate, and how these arise from a web of socio-cultural, political, economic, and ecological factors. By pleading for relational approaches to farming such as those acknowledging its immanent human-ecology interaction, this paper suggests a novel \"health-nutrition-ecology\" nexus to guide enquiry into the intimate relations between ecology, livelihoods, and health and well-being. It is employed to gain understanding of small-farming households' situations, deep-rooted causes of these, and their resilience in facing crises. The paper further pleads for a shift in existing technocratic agricultural discourses towards their inclusiveness of real-world narratives by small-scale farmers. These narratives can deliver insights for policies that aim at actual transformations of crisis-prone agro-food systems and could benefit both farmer livelihoods and farm ecologies.",

Regression analyses indicated that AI self-efficacy, instructional self-efficacy, engagement self-efficacy, workload, and anxiety all significantly predicted teacher wellbeing.

They compare historical population counts prior to flooding with estimates from global gridded population datasets and report that gridded population data underestimate people in these areas by more than 50%. Based on this, they claim that gridded population data systematically undercount rural populations around the world and suggest that rural census data are also flawed. We appreciate the authors’ interest in gridded population data accuracy but believe they misunderstood how these datasets are constructed and try to validate them by their performance in representing historical population changes around very local and rare flooding events, that are not representative for the quality of global, gridded population data measuring contemporary rural population distributions. Global, gridded population data rely on models that redistribute census-based population counts using geospatial data on water bodies and built-up areas, and other factors related to population presence and density. These models assume water bodies to be static over time and do not measure buildings that existed in the past but have since been dismantled, demolished, destroyed, or flooded. They are not designed to capture rare events like villages flooded by newly built water reservoirs. This is a known limitation, not a flaw, that has been clearly described by gridded population data producers. Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) measure effects of these limitations and exaggerate the scale of the problem. The total number of people displaced by dam construction in the analyzed data is small - less than 0.05% of the world’s population - yet they use relative error metrics that grossly inflate their results. They also avoid assessing if gridded population data overestimate post-flooding population in areas where the data on water bodies are out of date, which would invalidate their claim of “systematic underrepresentation”. Moreover, they confuse “missing data” with “misplaced data” - in many cases, the population is still represented in the gridded population data, just in slightly different locations. We estimate that population displacement due to reservoir construction causes such slight misplacements in global gridded population datasets affecting less than 2% of the global rural population, significantly lower than the claim by Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) of over 50% missing rural population globally. In this response, members of the POPGRID data collaborative explain why the conclusions by Láng-Ritter et al. (2025) are incorrect and not supported by the data or methods used. Moreover, we call for awareness of the limitations and fitness for use of global gridded population data.",

        "abstract": "This research examines changes in the short-term rental accommodation (STRA) market, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. It explores landlords’ perceptions and the factors influencing their decisions to move properties into or out of the STRA market. The STRA market has expanded globally since the advent of platforms such as Airbnb. As popularity has surged, there has been a trend towards ‘non-hosted STRA’ – where an entire property is rented without the host present. Australia’s housing crisis has intensified pressure on policymakers to address the impact of STRA on housing affordability and availability – especially in tourist areas. To do this, it is critical to understand the changing dynamics of STRA.",

        "abstract": "In everyday conversations, classrooms, workplaces, and online platforms, people often respond to accurate corrections with interpersonal coldness, distrust, or even punishment of the corrector. This review synthesizes dispersed evidence and theory to propose the Correctness Aversion Effect (CAE): a person-directed backlash that emerges when (a) a corrective message is relatively correct and hard to dismiss (high epistemic constraint), (b) that correctness is appraised as threatening to self, face, status, autonomy, or identity, and (c) negative responses are directed at the corrector rather than merely the message content. Moving beyond the correction literature’s dominant focus on belief updating and misinformation reduction, CAE highlights a layered outcome signature in which person evaluation and sanctioning can deteriorate even when epistemic accuracy improves or remains unchanged. We clarify CAE’s construct boundaries relative to shooting-the-messenger effects, backfire/correction resistance, psychological reactance, face-threatening acts, and the intergroup sensitivity effect, and we integrate these lines into a convergent process model: correction episodes (e.g., public exposure, status asymmetry, blunt tone, identity-laden domains) evoke multidimensional threat appraisals that recruit coordinated affective pathways (shame/embarrassment and envy escalating into defensive anger and resentment) and cognitive coping (motive derogation, moralization, source delegitimization, and “pulling-down” reframes), producing interpersonal avoidance, exclusion, and punitive intentions. Social comparison is specified as a key moderator (e.g., comparison orientation, rank concern) that amplifies rank-relevant encoding of being corrected. Finally, we provide an operational blueprint for future research—manipulations, mediator batteries, and layered dependent measures—designed to render CAE falsifiable and to support cumulative multi-study programs and intervention testing.",
