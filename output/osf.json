        "abstract": "The article evaluates how actors in Yemen's secessionist Southern Movement utilise social media and digital communications to construct a separate South Arabian national consciousness in opposition to the Yemeni identity. The article traces the history of the North/South Yemeni split into the modern crisis, and how the split transformed from a matter of competing legitimacy into one of self-determination. Southern Transitional Council (STC) media builds a national consciousness and assumes a 'primordial' South Arabia. This is done through creating a national narrative from historical events associated with South Yemen, the monarchies preceding South Yemen, and specific diction choices. Specific case studies are evaluated in demonstrating the South Arabian nationalist influencer model. Ultimately, this work finds that social media figures associated with the Southern Movement reflect this specific line of nationalist reasoning by claiming South Arabia as a natural nation-state under Yemeni occupation.",

        "abstract": "While international law and climate change researchers have shown how legal institutions and climate shocks impact human trafficking in origin and destination countries, little attention is given to the intermediary countries through which individuals are trafficked. We develop and test a two-part cost-based explanation of how anti-trafficking legalization and climate shocks impact trafficking patterns through intermediary countries. We argue that the diffusion of anti-trafficking laws induces pressures on traffickers to diversify their trafficking routes. We then theorize that climate shocks confound the effect of legal institutions by incentivizing traffickers to focus their resources on mitigating climate impacts. Evidence from inferential network analysis of human trafficking networks mined from the U.S. State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report (2009--2016) supports our arguments.",

        "authors": "ZHU Wen-Yi",
        "created": "2025-07-22",
        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is not the only or main force thrown upon politics by current scientific revolution. No man in social sense is not, or more than AI, and rulers in the past has long been mastering the more versatile and volatile Slave Intelligence. As a political community with enough surplus product can easily withstand malgovernance, without necessity or outcry for “Optimal Rule”, artificial intelligence will unlikely outgun or outvote human rulers. Among international competition barbarized by prospect of perpetual world domination through new technology, natural sciences and politics will no longer know ethics. People of nation states, if too little to rule themselves, will ask for a quasi-omnipotent protector, against artificial intelligence and foreign conquerors, at the price of total submission. This protector will be awarded with those very technology for a general artificial intelligence, to become a superhuman utterly integrated with machines, sooner, surer, and quicker than general artificial intelligence, or any other system of production and distribution past or foreign. Yet this will not make it any less human, as such integration is never absent or rare in human history. Through conquest, this superhuman ruler, itself a creation facilitated by international politics, may end international politics altogether, along with nation states. A superhuman ruler born of international politics, technology, and fear, is thus more likely the outcome of current scientific revolution, than scenarios of AI takeover/cataclysm/enthronement. Yet though thinkers of the past has already many foreshadows for such an outcome, actual future is still decided by actions of generations to come.",

        "authors": "Samuel L Leizerman",
        "created": "2025-07-23",
        "abstract": "I follow the foundational scientific method of using a formal proof to mathematically derive from first principles, relying on no external justification, proof that causality follows field theoretic principles. And in following this standard practice from pure and theoretical science, I start from axioms such as the applicability of generalized (nD + T) spacetime, with signature (−, +, ..., +), to formally subsume, reinterpret, and unify causal inference methods. I illustrate this unity by demonstrating its applicability to Difference-in-Differences (DiD), regression interaction effects, potential outcomes, Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM), and propensity scoring. Critically, I prove that Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Regression Kink Design (RKD) are field-theoretic boundary phenomena differentiated by the order of causal curvature discontinuity—interpretable as a collision angle within the manifold. This geometric-dynamical paradigm offers a novel mechanism for the detection of unobserved variable bias, leveraging tensor calculus and linear algebra. The framework’s predicted performance stems from its foundation in Lorentzian spacetime, the inherent mathematical structure of causality, providing a native environment for causal relationships that is inaccessible to methods operating on degraded, flattened projections of reality. True mathematical discontinuities are shown to be approximations arising when the characteristic time scale of a causal transition falls below the observational time step, analogous to the Planck time limit in physics. The empirical success of existing low-dimensional causal inference methods provides a compelling validation for the superior performance predicted out of mathematical necessity and of this higher-dimensional spacetime framework. NOTE: This is a first draft, expect errors and an additional section or two. (To the mod who rejected this and said this is not science, this is theoretical physics, but because, as I prove, physics is the science of causality (it just focuses on the ground state of the universe; matter, energy, and time), this proof, if validated by peers, has the potential to revolutionize the ENTIRETY OF QUANTITATIVE SCIENCE. Now I may be wrong on this proof in every single way; I’m not, at least not all.. Nevertheless, I if I am, so be it; such is the nature of theoretical science. But, I know this much for certain, people who do not know what theoretical science is or looks like should not be gatekeeping OPEN SCIENCE anymore than someone who can’t recognize a heart should be a cardio surgeon. If you think my claim unbelievable that is fine, take my work scrutinize it, and prove me wrong or don’t. As I said, maybe I am. But without the very scientific method used here in this paper there would be no relativity (Newtonian, general, or special), no information theory, no genetics, no quantum mechanics, no internet search engine, no AI, none of it. The lack of citations is not a bug, it is literally the point. The landmark papers from Einstein, Schrödinger, Gödel, Dirac, Hawking, Shannon, collectively had 0 citations. Simply put, this is the scientific methodology from which all other methods are born. If if it the policy of OSF is to prohibit the foundational methodology of science itself, they have an ethical obligation to state as much as official policy. This proof will either stand and speak for itself or it will crash and burn like Icarus. But here’s the reality, science demands that we allow good faith efforts to fail if that is their fate; to do anything else would be to stifle innovation and discovery. So I ask, are we here for open science or echo chambers?",

        "abstract": "Current scientific revolution may produce power so great, to rule out Irreversibility and Scarcity, short of permanent death, in anthrosphere. Such power, manifesting as probably an omnimachine, under direct human control, would thus become the most important means of production, political rights, and political power, in combination. Such power, fairly shared, would change meaning, relationship, and practise of political equality, freedom, and democracy for the better, as never before. Still, the omnimachine, powerful as it may be, will likely develop in a world of Nation States competing for it, and would not be able to choose its own owner. Frightened by “General AI” and “foreign threats”, and seeking protection in idolatry, citizens of nation states would likely create for themselves a superhuman dictator with the omnimachine. Yet this new and utter tyranny, could, ironically, offer so much more affluence, equality, freedom, and democracy than any government of the past, those most equal, free, or democratic included, if the superhuman wills. Even if people could once share the new power fairly among themselves, safeguarding it would would still be challenging. There would be, thus, no real escape from the duties of politics, collective or personal, through whatever power of natural sciences.",

        "authors": "ZHU Wen-Yi",
        "created": "2025-07-22",
        "abstract": "Plato`s political science is never exclusively ancient or Hellenic, but identifies, epitomizes, and explores the still current background of politics: the problematic “irreversibility” and “scarcity”. As an adequate discussion of such problem must probe into its past and future possibilities, Plato, a “spectator or all times and of all existence”, maneuvering colorful characters able to imagine a limited human likelihood of gods in the future, and narrating in prose and myth, tested the feasibility and sustainability of “perfect” political systems at all levels of technological development, in a world of inherent randomness, apparent physical laws, and free will. Revelation of this test, then, are twofold, that no political system, including those best-designed, could hope for static existence forever, due to the world`s innate randomness, regardless of whether “irreversibility” and “scarcity” was overcame with technology. Yet this same randomness could, at the same time, and on the contrary, deny despotism immortality and full legitimacy at least in theory, by protecting ethics and freedom from natural sciences, and preserving hope, through refusal of strict determinism in all manners. It is thus noteworthy, that in such Platonic world, and probably our world, political idleness would never be safe, even in the best-governed polity, of powerful technology, so self-loving people should always bear the burden, however light, of making themselves just in a just manner.",

        "created": "2025-07-24",
        "abstract": "Faced with a continually mounting array of shocks, surprises and shifts, there is an understandable search for frames to describe these confusing conditions. A combination of the collapse of previous certainties with the lack of a new paradigm solidifing has led many to depict the present moment as an interregnum. This is not a neutral term, to use it is to bring forth the poetic phrasing of Antonio Gramsci: ‘the old is dying and the new cannot be born’. Through a genealogical engagement with Gramsci’s prison notebook entry, this paper traces the remarkable trajectory of the term from obscurity to being adopted by commentators across the political spectrum. In the process, however, his insights have been flattened and thinned out, reduced to an analytical meme. Invoking Gramsci’s interregnum is often a way of sidestepping or avoiding more directly reckoning with challenging conditions of entropy and transformation. Bemoaning the death of the ‘old’ and the rise of ‘monsters’ is much easier than seriously reckoning with the contradictions and difficulties of an expanding empty space, one devoid of historical guarantees or clear precedents.",

        "abstract": "Climate institutions - including framework legislation and advisory bodies - have proliferated globally as part of countries' responses to climate change. They have received growing attention amid a broader 'institutional turn' in the study of climate politics. We lack conceptual tools, however, to analyse these meso-level institutions and disentangle the mechanisms driving their effects on climate policymaking. To fill this gap, we develop the Climate Institutions Analysis Framework (CIAF) and use it to qualitatively analyse climate institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia. We demonstrate how cross-country variation in effects stems from interactions between institutions and 'intervening variables' specific to countries' contexts. Across our sample, most institutions address agenda-setting and knowledge-related strategic challenges; few deliver ex-ante accountability and none compensation. Our framework is relevant for comparative political economy analyses of meso-level political institutions, and, alongside our results, offers lessons for policymakers seeking to create or improve climate institutions.",

        "abstract": "Faith is an essential requirement and a fundamental need intrinsic to humans as spiritual beings. Because humans possess consciousness, and will is an inherent component of consciousness—its origin and core—humans need to live in the process of fulfilling their will. In other words, humans need to live in hope. Consequently, faith arises. Faith is the hope humans create for themselves. The significance of this hope for humans does not lie in the necessity or the objective likelihood of achieving the goal, but precisely in this hope itself.Faith serves as humanity's spiritual pillar—a systematic, complete, and independently existing ideology. It assimilates and integrates elements of human consciousness such as knowledge, emotions, ideals, convictions, and morality, forming an organic whole. Not only does it provide purpose and direction for human life, but it also supplies principles for conduct and spiritual fortitude, ensuring humans eternally dwell in hope while fulfilling their multifaceted spiritual needs. Faith is a human necessity and simultaneously a political imperative, for a society requires shared faith to maintain cohesion. As the administration tasked with governing and serving society, politics ought to cultivate and guide public faith. This constitutes both the proper duty of politics and a service to politics itself, functioning as a vital means to promote political stability.",

        "authors": "Leonard Maximilian König",
        "created": "2025-07-17",
        "abstract": "This study investigates the role of language and discursive strategies in constructing and legitimizing truth claims about climate change as a security issue within the European Union (EU), focusing on European Parliament decisions and key Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) documents. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach, the research integrates quantitative computational linguistic techniques with qualitative critical discourse analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of how climate change is framed as a security threat in the EU's CFSP and its implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The findings reveal an increased emphasis on security implications of climate change, a higher focus on the relationship between climate change and security, and a shift in focus from topics such as migration, energy, and economic issues to human and environmental aspects, as well as defence and regional issues. The study also highlights the interconnectedness of securitisation and riskification framings in constructing climate change as a security issue within CFSP policy documents. These insights contribute to existing literature on climate change securitisation, critical discourse analysis, and policy-making within the EU context. The research underscores the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to address climate change-related security risks, prioritizing actions that address both direct impacts of climate change on ecosystems and societies, enhancing collaboration with various stakeholders, and developing policies that encompass a wide range of strategies for mitigation and adaptation efforts.",

        "abstract": "Economists routinely use survey measures of, for example, risk preferences, trust, political attitudes, or wellbeing. The literature generally treats numerical response categories as if they represent equal psychological intervals. We provide the first systematic test of this assumption, developing a general framework to quantify how easily results can be overturned when this linearity assumption is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that respondents interpret survey scales in ways that do deviate from linearity, but only mildly. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 30,000+ coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics journals. Replicated coefficient signs are remarkably robust to mild departures from linear scale-use. However, statistical inference and estimates of relative effect magnitudes become unreliable, even under modest departures from linearity. This is especially problematic for policy applications. We show that these concerns generalise to many other widely used survey-based constructs.",

        "abstract": "As the wave of digital civilization reshapes the global development paradigm, the integration of culture and technology is emerging as a new key to solving the challenge of regional coordination. This paper takes the phenomenal open-world game \"Genshin Impact\" as the research object, pioneeringly constructs a theoretical framework of \"virtual-reality\" bidirectional empowerment, and empirically tests the empowerment mechanism of Genshin Impact on common prosperity. The study finds that Genshin Impact drives the development of regional common prosperity through three intermediary channels, achieving a qualitative leap in efficiency: activating regional innovation level enhancement through an innovative network akin to the \"Sumeru Wisdom Sharing System\", realizing industrial structure upgrading through the upgrading effect of \"Stratovolcano Industrial Transformation\", and cultivating innovative consciousness and enhancing regional innovation activity through the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the \"Liyue Commerce Ecology\". Spatial heterogeneity analysis reveals that its effectiveness exhibits a \"geographical energy gradient distribution\" characteristic, with the eastern region benefiting from the resonance of digital infrastructure endowment and market response efficiency, the western region relying on the latecomer advantage of resource digital transformation for improvement, and the central region's role not yet evident. Furthermore, the temporary negative correlation in the northeast resembles the suppression of elemental reactions by the \"icy environment of the Winter Nation - Snezhnaya \", profoundly demonstrating the threshold effect of regional institutional adaptability. The innovation of this study lies in translating game narratives such as \"Contract Spirit\" and \"Grass God Think Tank\" into operational economic governance language, empirically responding to the strategic deployment of \"improving the modern cultural industry system\" proposed at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The policy implications emphasize the need to break down \" Enkanomiya-style\" administrative barriers and build \"Jade Chamber-style \" regional growth poles, so that the integration of culture and technology can truly become a new fulcrum for coordinated development in a \"seven nations resonate\" manner, just as Zhongli's adage goes: \"Although the rock remains unmoved, the rock patterns eventually connect - only the coexistence of all things can form an inexhaustible flow.\"",

Using data from Colombia between 2009 and 2017, we compute wage disparities by automation risk. We find that 62% of the occupied people in Colombia are at high-risk of automation. In the same way, we find that 71% of informal workers are at high-risk, while 56% of formal workers are. The wage return to education are highest in the less automatable occupations. We then look at the effects of actual education, measured by ICT investment. On wages and employment, automation increases employment, decreases wages and the wages gap by skill. Education acts as a protection mechanism against new automation technologies.",

        "abstract": "Kyrgyzstan serves as a key case study for the broader Central Asia–Russia labor pipeline, which supported an estimated 8 million migrants annually in 2020. Prior to the Russo-Ukraine war, remittances from Russia accounted for approximately 30% of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP, driven by over 10% of its population working in Russia. However, understanding wartime migration dynamics is challenging due to suspected political interference in Russian data, restricted foreign access to this data, and the informality that characterizes Central Asian migration patterns. This study incorporates Yandex Wordstat, Google Trends, XGBoost (which outperforms other machine learning methods), and autoregressive models to \"nowcast\" missing data. The results reveal a push effect linked to war onset in February 2022 and war intensity. However, all three of the analyzed migration datasets suggest a potential delayed labor substitution effect as Central Asian migrants fill vacancies left by conscripted Russian workers, proxied by casualty data from Mediazona and the BBC. The study also examines remittance trends, which seem to increase along with the labor substitution effect after a two-month lag. These results are robust to Russia- and Kyrgyzstan-side socioeconomic controls such as wage levels and population dynamics. This study provides new insight into the largely opaque Central Asia–Russia labor pipeline, a critical element in development policymaking for both regions. It also introduces a novel methodology for nowcasting migration trends, particularly through Yandex Wordstat, which has been largely overlooked in English-language scholarship.",

Studying these emotional experiences is challenging due to limited longitudinal data. To address this, we curated high-quality data and analyzed Twitter activities of immigrants in the US to explore how their expressed sentiments evolve post-migration, comparing them to non-immigrants and US locals in a quasi-causal sense. Our findings revealed that migration generally boosts positive sentiments among immigrants, even when discussing the same topics, and that this effect lasts up to one year post-migration. However, there is no conclusive evidence that migration significantly impacts negative sentiments. Additionally, age and gender play a key role, with younger population and females more likely to express positive sentiments post-migration, while linguistic ties help foster increased positivity.

        "abstract": "Privacy-enhancing and other related digital technologies are marketed as increasing trust within the digital society. They are deployed as means to assert trust in digital transactions and interactions between actors. What this commentary argues is that digital trust is thereby reduced to the product of a technological iteration, insertion, or fix: more encryption ≃ more privacy ≃ more trust. However righteous it may be to foster privacy, the promise to uphold something as uncertain as trust by the use of mathematics and/or statistics alone is short-sighted. Lofty notions like ‘data minimisation’ and ‘privacy-by-design’ rest on deterministic assumptions. We suggest that in reductively appropriating the concept of trust and failing to meet expectations, the consequences of the technification of trust – i.e., the making of trust a product of technê (alone) – are paradoxical in that they actually undermine trust, by centralising power within tech companies.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates gender differences in online toxicity towards a sample of candidates in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Using data from five EU countries and drawing on a dataset of over 3.2 million posts mentioning 88 candidates, we applied a mixed-methods approach to assess the volume and nature of online abuse. Toxicity levels were measured using a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm. After developing a comprehensive coding scheme, qualitative content analysis was performed on a subset of posts with the highest probability of being perceived as toxic to examine gendered patterns of abuse. While a purely quantitative analysis did not reveal significant differences between the number of toxic replies received by female and male candidates that the gender alone could explain, qualitative insights uncovered systematic semiotic violence against women in politics. Female politicians were more often targeted with personal and degrading attacks, including sexist slurs, sexually explicit content, and attempts to silence or delegitimise them. In contrast, male candidates were likelier to receive insults tied to their political conduct and professional criticism. Moreover, replies to women are significantly more likely to include multiple elements of toxicity, indicating a higher intensity of online harassment. These results underscore the need for platform and user accountability, nuanced moderation policies, and legal protections that reflect the gendered dimensions of online political violence. Our research highlights the persistence of digital misogyny as a barrier to gender parity in democratic participation and stresses the urgency of cross-sectoral strategies to combat this issue during electoral processes.",

To evaluate our hypotheses we present a pre-registered online experiment with 1,160 respondents who were exposed to social media accounts with varied visual cues about their race, gender, and partisanship. We find that people from dominant social groups are more likely to classify members of minority groups as AI bots—however, our results also show that members of some minority groups are more likely to classify each other as AI bots. These findings suggest existing social hierarchies extend into human-AI interaction, creating a new burden for marginalized groups in online settings and complicating the processes of social identity construction more broadly. Our research thus contributes to an emerging sociology of generative artificial intelligence by revealing how technological disruption challenges ontology and inter-group relations and introduces new methods to study this process in online settings.",

In this article, we identify the various manifestations of caregiver well-being, test rural-suburban-urban differences, and explore the role of state-level family policy. Drawing on responses from 4,620 caregivers of adults and children to the STAT Caregiving surveys from the North Central and Northeast Regions of the United States, we use latent class analysis to develop a caregiver well-being typology. We identify three latent classes of caregiver well-being: high, medium, and low and describe the composition of each class. Next, we use multinomial logistic regression to test differences between rural, suburban, and urban caregivers in their probability to be in each well-being class, while accounting for individual-level characteristics and the state-level context of care infrastructure. We find that rural and suburban caregivers are overrepresented among the low and medium well-being classes and underrepresented among the high well-being class relative to their urban counterparts. Additionally, caregivers’ own characteristics vary more across well-being than does the state-level family policy context. Our findings speak to the importance of robust family care policies that are attuned to differences in social and built infrastructure across rural, suburban, and urban residence.",

        "abstract": "This chapter reviews some of the decolonial theory that has had significant impact on the current research that seeks to decolonize peace and conflict studies, as well as potential pathways for the further decolonization of the field. Much decolonial research on peace and conflict studies has critiqued the Eurocentrism and universalism that persists in the global peacebuilding architecture. Research that comprises this decolonial turn in peace studies often implements a pluriversal approach to conflict analysis and peacebuilding in opposition to the universalistic “expertise” through which Eurocentric peacebuilding often travels, as outlined in this chapter. We connect pluriversal peace research to the decolonial potential of subaltern cosmopolitanism, the latter of which is already underway and yet has seen little engagement in peace and conflict studies. The emergent project of subaltern cosmopolitanism, along with the pluriversal and postabyssal way of thinking from which it issues, can support the decolonization of the practice of peacebuilding, its institutional contexts, and its academic study. To demonstrate the practical importance of subaltern cosmopolitanism and indigenous epistemologies, this chapter highlights approaches to justice and reconciliation in Colombia and Rwanda. We conclude by emphasizing some aspects of peace and conflict that could be illumined and problematized through further decolonial research.",

Background: Previous research documented a negative impact of disadvantageous family transitions and family instability on children’s educational outcomes. However, there is a theoretical and empirical debate surrounding the most appropriate measure of family complexity during childhood. Method: Numerous theoretically conceptualized sequence-based complexity measures are applied to parents’ life history data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, which were linked to children’s test scores in the National Pupils Dataset. Average within-child change in boys’ and girls’ math and English tests scores following change in mothers’ and fathers’ family complexity were estimated with fixed-effects regressions. Results: Family complexity measures were largely found to be negatively associated with children’s academic performance, however with differences across indicators. The number of transitions as well as the uncertainty and sum of disadvantage indicators were most tightly associated with children’s test scores. In addition, results varied by parents’ and children’s gender. For example, family complexity for fathers was often positively associated with children’s educational outcomes and associations were often stronger for boys compared to girls. Conclusion: Findings highlight the importance of theoretically derived measures of family complexity. In this study, measures associated with family instability and parental absence were shown to be most strongly linked with children’s educational outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Background/Context: As states implement policies to expand STEM pathways, addressing persistent gender gaps in STEM education and careers remains a critical concern. In 2014–2015, Texas introduced a high-school graduation policy requiring students to declare an academic endorsement, similar to a high school major, including a STEM option. Beginning with the class of 2018, students in the Houston Independent School District (HISD) were subject to this policy. In 2019, HISD added a personalized intervention: high-school guidance counselors conducted Personal Graduation Plan (PGP) check-ins with seniors to assess progress toward endorsement completion. These check-ins may have served as a form of social capital, influencing students’ endorsement decisions, including girls’ persistence in STEM pathways. Purpose: This study examines whether personalized guidance counseling can affect gender gaps in STEM choice. We examine whether a district-wide policy requiring senior-year check-ins might have influenced girls’ persistence in STEM, with particular attention to students from low-income backgrounds and underserved neighborhoods. Research Design: We use HISD administrative data to analyze endorsement selections and changes over time for the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. We begin by assessing gender gaps in ninth-grade STEM endorsement selection using binary logistic regression. We then use multinomial logistic regression to examine whether the PGP check-ins are associated with differential persistence patterns by gender and cohort. Results: We find persistent gender gaps in STEM endorsement selection beginning in ninth grade, with girls less likely than boys to choose STEM. Without personalized counseling, these gaps persisted through graduation. However, the PGP check-in was associated with a disproportionate reduction in girls dropping the STEM endorsement and a greater likelihood of adding STEM, especially among girls from low-income backgrounds and underserved neighborhoods. Conclusions: These findings suggest that relational interventions like personalized guidance counseling may help mitigate gender disparities in STEM pathways. Expanding access to such interventions may promote greater equity in STEM education and beyond.",

        "abstract": "For ambitious young Chinese students, gaining admission to an exclusive group of universities is a critical step toward entering elite spheres of Chinese society. Educators and policymakers often explain admissions and school choices through asocial concepts of meritocracy like gaokao-score-based tournaments and rational choice explanations. Organizational scholars emphasize cultural matching as an interpersonal recruitment mechanism. However, both frameworks fail to explain how standardized testing and cultural processes work together, albeit at different analytical levels. This article addresses this limitation by offering the first systematic analysis of the high-stakes admission competition between China's top two universities, Peking and Tsinghua. Based on participant observation of university recruiters (promoters) in Mango Province during the annual post-gaokao enrollment period, this study examines how merit is negotiated on the ground. I find that numbers game is prioritized at the institution and student levels, while cultural matching emerges at the promoter level. Universities focus on securing top-1 students (zhuangyuan) and boosting reported admission cutoffs. Students often cannot meaningfully distinguish between the two institutions. This allows promoters to \"guide\" students to their institutions by mediating between student decision-making and institutional goals. They accomplish this work by using three distinct practices. First, as institutional agents, they deploy emotional appeals to evaluate and promote a sense of \"fit.\" Second, as peer-like figures, they guide students to internalize dominant judgments of the \"small-town swot,\" leading them to reinterpret their own success as mechanical, narrow, or lacking in elite polish. Third, by calling themselves \"volunteers,\" they blur the boundary between institutional authority and personal goodwill, masking their strategic role in the admissions process. This article contributes to theories of merit under egalitarian governance, by showing how critical decision-making junctures actively construct meritocracy and the social meaning of elite status in the world.",

        "abstract": "Studying the relationship between neighborhoods and individual-level outcomes such as crime, labor market success, or intergenerational mobility has a long history in the social sciences. As local processes such as gentrification or residential mobility constantly change neighborhoods’ composition and spatial expansion, time-constant one-size-fits-all neighborhood measures fail to capture important local dynamics. This paper presents a flexible and data-driven approach for efficiently estimating overlapping and arbitrarily shaped neighborhoods with time-dynamic boundaries. Constructed in a two-stage clustering design, the first stage identifies homogeneous groups within a city (using an automated K-Means algorithm), while the second stage clusters homogeneous groups by spatial proximity (using the HDBSCAN algorithm). In an analysis of 86 million person-year observations from 76 German cities, the paper shows that a larger spatial expansion of neighborhoods with a high socioeconomic status negatively correlates with city crime cases, while higher neighborhood fragmentation and heterogeneity correlate positively with crime rates. The findings stress the importance of flexible neighborhood estimation techniques and the necessity to view neighborhoods as non-constant entities. By modeling contexts as such agentic players, the two-staged algorithm depicts a novel and transparent tool to consider the spatial embeddedness of individuals, firms, or regions in sociological research.",

        "abstract": "Gender scholars have debated whether the recent movement toward a more equal division of domestic labor is stalling. Using a differential convergence perspective, we argue that examining which domestic tasks experience gender convergence, whose changes narrow the gap, and why changes happen is critical for understanding gender convergence in domestic labor time. Drawing on data from the 2003-22 American Time Use Survey, we examine trends in core housework, occasional housework, shopping, and childcare time. Results for married women and men indicate that the historically large gender gap in housework time narrowed further this century, from a women-to-men ratio of 1.8:1 in 2003-05 to 1.5:1 in 2022. The decrease in the gender gap was concentrated in traditionally “feminine” core housework (from 4.2:1 to 2.5:1), particularly in housecleaning and laundry. The gender gap in shopping time also narrowed significantly, reaching gender parity. However, the gender gap in childcare time remained at a mother-to-father ratio of 2:1. Decomposition analyses indicate that women’s reduced housework time could mainly be explained by population compositional changes, whereas men’s increased housework time reflected behavioral changes. With men taking on more “female-typed” domestic activities, the gendered norms associated with different types of domestic labor may be becoming redefined.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the dynamics of structurally reproduced emotional expressions—what we term emotional memes—within organizational culture, using culturally shared symbolic character structures as a theoretical framework. Emotions are not merely internal phenomena; they are selectively expressed, maintained, and propagated under structural and institutional pressures. This study classifies the memetic structures that shape emotional orders within organizations into six archetypes: “the Gian-type (Big G)” (domination through anger), “Suneo-type (Sneech)” (silence and complicity), “Shizuka-type (Sue)” (asymmetric recognition), “Nobita-type (Noby)” (sacrificial exclusion), “Doraemon-type” (external intervention), and “Dekisugi-type” (overadaptation and invisibility). In an additional chapter, we introduce a seventh type—“Dorami-type” (non-disruptive support)—as a complementary external support structure. These archetypes illustrate how emotions are institutionally selected and reproduced under structural selection pressure. The framework challenges conventional binary analyses of harassment (perpetrator/victim) and proposes a new perspective: emotions are not freely expressed but structurally selected. By visualizing these hidden dynamics of emotional order, the paper offers a memetic lens for organizational transformation.",

Using mixed methods—situational analysis, qualitative case studies, and participatory observations—the study explored how aspirations are formed and negotiated. While both girls and boys face structural barriers, girls contend with deeper restrictions on mobility, access to resources, and control over their agency and decision-making. Gendered violence, both within homes and in public spaces, further undermines their sense of agency and overall well-being. The findings underscore the importance of gender-sensitive, community-rooted interventions that expand adolescents’ real freedoms and choices, strengthen their capacity to aspire, and enable them—especially girls—to imagine and pursue more just and equitable futures.",

        "abstract": "Endogamous marriages in India reflect a socially segregated society based on religion and caste, perpetuating the existing social stratification and inequalities. Caste endogamy contributes to the unequal transfer of social capital and social endowments, thereby reproducing inequalities within and across generations. In this background, the study examined the question of whether Inter-caste marriages contribute to reducing economic inequality in children’s nutrition. We triangulated analyses based on pooled microdata and macro-panel data compiled from the National Family Health Survey and other Government surveys (2005-2021). The Wagstaff’s corrected concentration index, panel data random effects regression models, and pooled cross-sectional probit regression model have been used. Findings suggest the continued prevalence of caste-based assortative sorting in the Indian marriage market and wealth-based inequalities in child nutritional status, thereby indicating both strong caste endogamy and health inequalities. However, an increase in Inter-caste marriage is associated with declining inequalities in the child nutrition indicators: stunting, wasting, and underweight. The pathway is established through the reduced economic heterogeneity in populations owing to inter-caste marital arrangements and a greater possibility of exchange of resources. Thus, we advance that Inter-caste marriages lessen caste inequalities in child nutrition in India by narrowing group differences in socio-economic status.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning is transforming fields like chemistry, engineering, and medicine, but its application to social science fields like demography remains limited. This study explores deep learning as an emerging approach to mortality forecasting, a core area in demographic research. This paper addresses why and how deep learning performs better than three well-known baselines for mortality forecasting. First, it explores the relationship between model architecture and data pooling. Second, it provides a detailed country-level performance analysis, identifying contexts where deep learning underperforms and exploring possible remedies. Third, it discusses the broader applicability and potential of deep learning methods in demography. The findings underscore the potential of deep learning to enhance demographic forecasting and invite broader reflection on the role of computational and AI-driven methods in population studies.",

        "abstract": "In an age where volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) are prevalent, modern companies are increasingly adopting Agile methods to foster resilience and innovation. With its focus on adaptability, teamwork, and empowerment, nimble leadership is offered as a new answer to current problems. However, this paper contends that the underlying tenets of this leadership style are not novel but are instead firmly founded in the divine guidance of the Holy Quran and the actual example (Seerah) of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). This visual academic article investigates the great parallels between the fundamental concepts of Agile leadership and the eternal Islamic ideals of Shura (consultation), Amanah (trust), Tafwid (delegation), Adl (justice), and Ihsan (excellence). By means of a methodical study, it creates a conceptual framework that connects modern Agile values directly to Quranic teachings. The study shows how the Quran presents an adaptive and goal-oriented model of leadership that is holistic, ethically sound, and spiritually based. This essay offers a fresh viewpoint for leaders of every background by highlighting these links and proposes that a closer interaction with this 1400-year-old knowledge can inspire and improve 21st century leadership practice.",

        "abstract": "Teleological argument has been a cornerstone of natural theology, suggesting that complexity and order in the universe imply a purposeful designer. Early forms used biological analogies, while modern expressions incorporate sophisticated mathematical and physical concepts. This paper explores the philosophical and theological use of two such fields: fractal geometry and differential geometry. It argues that while these disciplines cannot, by their very nature, provide a formal \"proof\" of God's (Allah's) existence, they serve as powerful and compelling metaphorical frameworks for understanding divine attributes such as immanence, transcendence, omnipotence, and omniscience. By examining the self-similarity and infinite complexity of fractals and the elegant, fine-tuned structure of the cosmos described by differential geometry, this paper analyzes how these mathematical concepts are employed to reinvigorate the teleological argument, shifting the discourse from a claim of logical proof to an epistemology of awe and wonder.",

        "abstract": "Background In the UK, consumption of alcohol-free and low-alcohol (NoLo) drinks is more prevalent among heavier drinkers and socially advantaged groups. If heavier drinkers are substituting alcoholic drinks with NoLo drinks, this could improve public health. However, socioeconomic differences in consumption could exacerbate alcohol-related health inequalities. Socioeconomic groups vary in their reasons for drinking alcohol, with less advantaged individuals more likely to drink alcohol to cope. This study examined whether alcohol drinking motives can help explain differences in NoLo consumption, with a particular aim of understanding socioeconomic differences. Methods 2,555 adults residing in Great Britain provided data on at-least monthly NoLo consumption, hazardous drinking (AUDIT-C), alcohol drinking motives, social grade, education, age, and gender, via the Alcohol Toolkit Study. Path analysis explored the mediating effects of drinking motives between sociodemographic characteristics, hazardous drinking, and NoLo consumption. Results Drinking alcohol to conform, education, and hazardous drinking were positively associated with NoLo consumption. Drinking alcohol to cope with depression was a serial mediator between social grade and NoLo. Drinking to cope with depression, more frequently reported among lower social grades, weakened the positive relationship between hazardous drinking and NoLo consumption (β = -0.001, 95% CI -0.002, -0.000). Enhancement and social motives also weakened this relationship, partially mediating pathways between age, gender, education, and NoLo consumption. Discussion Whilst hazardous drinking is positively associated with NoLo consumption, for those drinking to cope with depression, for enhancement, or social reasons, this effect is diminished, potentially limiting the public health potential for these groups.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to contribute to knowledge about the connection between platform studies and comparative party politics. More specifically, to gain new knowledge about the history of user-creation about Swedish political parties on Wikipedia. This study maps the user-created history of Swedish political parties on the platform Wikipedia over a twenty-year period. Users’ contributions construct articles by making edits (N=20,906). The study focuses on whether users edit political articles differently, in which order political parties appeared, the relation of election years (heightened political activity) to frequencies of user edits, and whether the overall evolution of content on political parties’ articles is in a process of growth, standstill or decline. The results show that parties without government representation have the highest frequency of editing when related to parties’ political support in elections. This tendency is stronger on the far-right side of the political scale. The Sweden Democrats was the first party on Wikipedia (2002) and within six months most parties followed. Elections were initially related to higher edit frequencies. Users’ editing peaked the first 15 years, but has then merged on a lower level. The conclusions suggest that when studying this type of political platform user engagement, the following factors matter: The age of the platform, whether the party holds a dominant position, whether the party's support is increasing, whether the party is excluded from governmental collaboration, whether the party has a far-out political position on the left-right scale, and finally, whether the party is a right-wing party.",

It specifically analyzes \"Sport-Oriented Micro Smart Cities\", arguing that large-scale, technologically advanced sports complexes (elite training centers, academies, stadiums) are evolving into such entities. This transformation is driven by the integration of smart technologies and the adoption of selected urban functions (like housing, services, and operational self-sufficiency), allowing these facilities to emulate urban characteristics despite lacking municipal governance. Case studies of modern sports infrastructure illustrate this evolution. The paper contributes to understanding smart city scalability and the diverse manifestations of smart urbanism in specialized, micro-scale contexts.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the influence of cultural taboos on English Language Teaching (ELT) within the Arab Gulf region, where societal norms and Islamic traditions significantly shape pedagogical approaches. It identifies educators' primary challenges, such as navigating culturally sensitive topics like religion, gender roles, and family dynamics, which impact curriculum design, classroom interactions, and material selection. A recent literature review and thematic analysis reveal strategies for addressing these challenges, including contextualised materials, role-playing, and reflective exercises. These methods indirectly enable teachers to engage with cultural taboos, fostering student participation while respecting local sensitivities. The study emphasises the importance of intercultural competence as a critical skill for educators, equipping them to mediate cultural dynamics and create inclusive learning environments. Findings indicate that culturally responsive teaching facilitates language acquisition and promotes empathy and understanding among students from diverse cultural backgrounds. Implications include the need for ongoing professional development for ELT practitioners, focusing on strategies to balance cultural respect with pedagogical objectives. Addressing these issues, the research contributes to advancing culturally competent language education, offering practical solutions for integrating cultural sensitivity into ELT practices in the Gulf region and beyond.",

Despite these advantages, tourist travel flow can have unexpected effects, such as spreading diseases, like sexually transmitted infections (STIs), that affect public health. However, identifying possible correlations between tourism activities in regions and disease incidence is a relevant research issue that has not yet been extensively explored. According to the World Health Organization, syphilis is a worldwide STI with an estimated impact of 8 million adults between 15 and 49 years old in 2022. This paper investigates and analyses evidence concerning the correlation between tourism activities and geographical location with syphilis incidence. The correlation analysis uses a machine learning algorithm to cluster the governmental syphilis notification database of Bahia state in Brazil between 2010 and 2019. Evidence analysis suggests correlations between tourism activities in coastal tourism municipalities and the incidence of syphilis. Identified evidence of a correlation allows proactive preventive actions and positively impacts the municipality's public health sector.",

        "created": "2025-07-15",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: More U.S. communities are pushing for urban greening to make cities more sustainable and better able to handle climate change. Still, there is growing worried that greening efforts can make gentrification worse and force individuals who are already at risk to move. A recent study shows that improvements to the environment and changes in the housing market in rapidly changing urban areas are connected in many ways. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to empirically look at the order and factors that affect the connection between urban greening and gentrification in Denver, Colorado. The goal is to improve fair urban sustainability policies by looking at both numerical and descriptive data about how neighborhoods change, how people in those neighborhoods feel, and how policies respond. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used, which included longitudinal geographic analysis, fieldwork, interviews with stakeholders, surveys of the community, and analysis of policy documents. The study looks at neighborhoods in Denver that are getting a lot of new green infrastructure and are seeing changes in their populations. Difference-in-differences modeling, theme coding, and triangulation of various data sources are all parts of data analysis. RESULTS: The results show that gentrification often happens before major urban greening projects, which sets the stage for future environmental investments that make exclusion and displacement worse. Quantitative models show big increases in eviction filings and rent burden after investments in green infrastructure. Qualitative statistics, on the other hand, show that vulnerable groups are likely to be displaced and that participatory planning is lacking. 1 IMPACT STATEMENT: This study gives new real-world data about how green gentrification changes over time, showing that both market factors and government policies affect how neighborhoods change. The study shows how policies should include anti-displacement strategies in programs to improve the environment and stresses the need for urban planning that is proactive and focused on fairness. Researchers and legislators who want to create fair and long-lasting cities are given suggestions.",
