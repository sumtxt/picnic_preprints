        "abstract": "Human choices are often multi-dimensional. For example, a person deciding which of two immigrants is more worthy of admission to a country might weigh the prospective immigrants' education, age, country of origin, and employment history. Conjoint experiments have rapidly generated new insight into these multidimensional choices. By independently randomizing the attributes of a pair of fictitious profiles, researchers summarize the average contribution that each attribute makes to an overall choice. But what if the effect of one attribute depends on the values of other attributes? We present a method that uses data-adaptive experimentation to search for heterogeneity in the effect of one focal attribute as a function of all other attributes. Our empirical application of this method shows that U.S. adults weigh the education of an immigrant much more heavily for certain immigrants than for others. By targeting the heterogeneous effects of a focal attribute, our approach complements conjoint designs that target the average effects of all attributes.",

        "authors": "Johannes Petry",
        "created": "2025-04-25",
        "abstract": "Commodities are crucial for understanding China’s economic rise but financial aspects of commodity markets are often neglected in existing debates. However, commodity prices are increasingly determined through trading in futures markets. Historically, most commodity benchmarks were traded on futures exchanges in New York, Chicago and London (infrastructure), dominated by Anglo-American financial institutions (investor), USD-denominated (currency), and supervised by US/UK regulators (regulatory). The article develops the concept of (commodity) pricing power as resulting from a combination of these different sources of power which further solidifies US financial hegemony, while putting China into a subordinate position. It thus provides a novel perspective for understanding the politics of commodities, global finance and China’s role therein. Based on policy documents, financial data and 200 expert interviews, the paper explores China’s efforts for establishing its own commodity benchmarks, tracing how (a lack of) commodity pricing power emerged as a problem for Chinese authorities and was subsequently pursued as a national development strategy for gaining more autonomy from US-dominated markets. While we often perceive China as a powerful actor, the paper illustrates how the market-based, financialised setup of international economic affairs can fundamentally constrain China’s global influence, even placing it into a position of profound vulnerability.",

        "abstract": "Many human groups employ hierarchical decision-making, in which only a few individuals hold the power to make decisions for the collective. A common explanation for the prevalence of hierarchical decision-making is that it provides group-level benefits by speeding up the decision-making process. However, groups can often do better by taking more time to explore a problem space or generate ideas. These contrasting accounts suggest that hierarchical or egalitarian decision structures may emerge under different circumstances. To more clearly distinguish between these circumstances, we studied an evolutionary model of group decision-making that includes both intra-group and inter-group dynamics. We show that the emergent social structure depends critically on the trade-off between speed and decision quality: scenarios that demand rapid decisions favor the evolution of skewed, hierarchical structures, while scenarios that reward extended deliberation favor the evolution of flat, egalitarian structures. Our results suggest that, instead of inevitably becoming centralized and hierarchical, groups and organizations are likely to evolve social structures that reflect the relationship between the speed and the quality of decisions they collectively make.",

        "authors": "Timm Betz, Leonhard Hummel",
        "created": "2025-04-29",
        "abstract": "Why are some firms more successful than others in obtaining privileged treatment from their government? Trade policy, as an unusually targeted redistributive tool, offers a rich context to understand such questions of special interest politics and corporate power. Studying decisions on anti-dumping petitions in the U.S., we introduce a novel source of privileged treatment. We argue that firms with more linkages throughout the domestic economy enjoy a privileged political position. Benefits to these firms extend indirectly to a broader set of constituents, which allows firms to assemble broader coalitions and to portray protectionist policy as more than purely particularistic politics. We provide evidence for this argument by developing original measures of linkages between firms, derived from over 600,000 customer-supplier relationships among industries, matching them with data on anti-dumping petitions filed by U.S. firms, written briefs filed by Members of Congress on behalf of these firms, and the geographic distribution of industries. Our account identifies a new explanation of differences in the political influence of firms, underscores the relevance of domestic production networks in politics, and offers a new perspective on cleavages and coalitions in trade politics. Our results also suggest that the expansion of global supply chains, long considered a hallmark of political power, may have weakened the political clout of some of the largest firms by limiting their domestic footprint.",

However, reports of anti-vaccine policymaking (AVP) across state legislatures have been largely anecdotal. We offer a first-of-its-kind effort to quantify and standardize reporting of the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of AVP by introducing the State Vaccine Policy Project (SVPP) database; a content-coded record of every piece of vaccine-related legislation introduced across all US state houses from 2019 - 2023. SVPP data reveal that both the total volume and proportion of anti-vaccine bills introduced across state legislatures has been increasing steadily since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 1 in 10 anti-vaccine bills signed into law during that period. We also show that the rise in anti-vaccine legislating is attributable primarily to the legislative actions of state lawmakers affiliated with the Republican party, and that dozens of anti-vaccine bills directly aim to reduce the scope of vaccine mandates. In addition to offering a standardized and exhaustive assessment of the growth of anti-vaccine policy making across US state legislatures, our work provides scholars with a unique dataset for studying changes in the vaccine policy environment.",

        "abstract": "How does partisanship affect inflation expectations? While most research focuses on how inflation impacts political approval and voter behavior, we analyze the political roots of inflation expectations. We argue that elections serve as key moments when citizens update their economic outlook based on anticipated policy changes, and that partisanship influences these re-evaluations. Using a two-wave panel survey conducted before and after the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we show that partisan alignment strongly shapes inflation expectations. Democrats reported heightened inflation expectations, anticipating inflationary policies under a Trump administration, while Republicans expected inflation to fall. These shifts reflect partisan interpretations of economic policy rather than objective forecasts. We also analyze the characteristics of those who are more likely to update inflation expectations and in what direction. Importantly, we verify that individuals with strong partisan attitudes exhibit less anchored inflation expectations. Our findings have implications beyond the case under analysis. From a policy perspective, our results underscore the challenges central banks face in anchoring inflation expectations in an era of political polarization, where economic perceptions differ sharply across partisanship lines.",

        "abstract": "Academic expertise is a key pillar of governance processes around the world. A goal of policy and public sector actors is to draw on research to improve decision making, and correspondingly, a goal of public policy and public administration researchers is to provide relevant expertise. It is not clear, however, to what extent these goals are achieved. This study uses the Overton database to analyse the influence of public policy and administration research on policy documents (broadly defined as documents published by policy and public sector organizations). It considers which research is cited by policy documents and which organizations cite research more than others to justify their decisions. The findings show that measuring the influence of academic expertise is not straightforward conceptually or methodologically. However, they emphasise the role of different organization types for achieving a greater correspondence between research and policy. Specifically, our study shows that think tanks use public policy and administration research more often than government organizations when justifying decisions. The findings provide insight into the utility of new policy databases in illuminating how academic experts can influence the ideas and actions of policy and public sector actors.",

Focusing on the adoption of genetically engineered (GE) soy seeds in Brazil, we find a decline in female landownership in GE soy-exposed municipalities. We examine the role of mechanisms like credit access, property rights, and gender norms. The effects are more pronounced where rural credit is more abundant but weaker where women receive a larger share of it, and are amplified where property rights are stronger and gender norms more unequal. Our findings highlight the unintended consequences of the spread of new technologies on rural asset ownership, underscoring the importance of considering gender disparities in crafting agricultural and climate change strategies.",

        "abstract": "This paper documents the disruptive role of antipersonnel landmines in the consolidation of post-conflict democracy. Leveraging the exogeneity in the timing of landmine explosions relative to election days, we compare electoral outcomes in voting polls located near pre-election explosions with those near post-election blasts. We find that landmine explosions act as salient stimuli, inducing fear and reducing voter turnout across the political spectrum. Due to the impossibility of manipulating the timing of a landmine explosion, our strategy uncovers the pure emotional effect of violence, net of any strategic objective of its perpetrator. Landmine bursts also induce emotion-driven changes in the voting behavior of those who do vote, thus altering electoral dynamics in addition to deterring political participation. Our findings highlight a novel dimension of the hidden costs of landmines, providing evidence on the intersection of conflict-related trauma and democratic consolidation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Mental health problems are increasing, while childlessness is becoming more common. We examine how mental health disorders (MHD) of varying prevalence, severity, and symptoms (common, severe, and behavioural and addiction-related disorders) are related to childlessness, and whether these associations are explained by partnerships and the partner’s mental health. We use Finnish total population register data on cohorts born between 1977 and 1980 and follow individuals from the age of 18 to 39. We estimate discrete-time event history models for the annual likelihood of having a child for men and women, with MHDs, co-residential partnership, and the partner’s MHDs as the main explanatory variables. We measure MHD by using both diagnose information (ICD-10 codes) from the special health care registers and medication information (ATC-codes). All types of MHDs predicted lower likelihood of having a child, the annual probability being 0.8–1.3%-points lower for women and 1.0–1.8 %-points for men in age-controlled models. The strongest association was observed for severe mental disorders. Co-residential partnerships explained part of the difference between those with and without MHD (for any MHD 13% for women and 36% for men compared to age-controlled model). When both partners have an MHD, the likelihood for childlessness was higher compared to partners where only one of the partners had an MHD. We conclude that partnerships and partner’s mental health are important factors in explaining the relationship between mental health disorders and childlessness, particularly among men.",

        "abstract": "Many national education systems have schools that adopt distinctive elements like alternative pedagogical concepts or specialty themes. This “school profiling” is thought to drive school segregation by socio-economic status (SES). However, since most existing research has focused on U.S. charter schools and lacks large-scale student-level data, the connection between profiling and SES-based school sorting remains unclear. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the case of the Netherlands, a country known for its high school autonomy and freedom of school choice. I use population-wide register data from over 110,000 students (aged 11–12), linked to novel data on school profiling. The findings reveal social stratification in access to schools with distinctive profiles, with higher SES students having access to a more diverse pool of schools. Furthermore, conditional logit models show evidence of self-sorting by SES for some profiles: for instance, schools with progressive learning concepts are less popular among lower SES students, while higher SES students are comparatively less likely to choose labor market-themed schools. These SES disparities, however, are modest and not always in the expected direction. Overall, findings underscore the role of access disparities in shaping SES-based sorting, next to differential preferences for schooling.",

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (1990–2019) and an event study design, the analysis tracks poverty dynamics among partnered individuals in the eight years around the birth of their first child and compares gender-specific poverty risk under the assumptions of full income pooling (assessing household poverty risk) and no income pooling (assessing individual poverty risk). While the average household poverty risk remains low and stable around childbirth, the average individual poverty risk for women rises sharply, peaking at 59% one year after childbirth and persisting at a high level up to five years later, indicating a motherhood penalty relative to their partners and childless women. Analyses by year of first birth show a declining yet persistent motherhood penalty on women’s poverty risk for younger cohorts. The findings suggest that reliance on household poverty measures masks individual vulnerability, particularly among mothers, and highlight the need for poverty measures that capture individual economic resilience. These findings call for further policy and research attention to individual poverty measures to inform strategies that promote equitable economic outcomes within partnerships.",

Longer family leave has been shown to weaken women’s labour market positions and some studies have found heterogenous effects across population groups. However, whether the effect differs by partnership status remains unexplored. Using Finnish register data from 1989 to 2014 (ca. 2.5 million person-years) and controlling for selection into single motherhood by comparing estimates from OLS and FE models, this study compares single and patnered mothers’ unemployment and earnings consequent to extended family leaves. In line with predictions that single mothers may face greater work-family reconciliation issues or cumulative disadvantage leading to greater labour market penalties, the results showed that longer leave increases the length of unemployment for single mothers more than for partnered ones. This is not solely because of selection into single motherhood. Earnings penalties after family leave (net of employment status) are the same for single and partnered mothers. We conclude that similar long- lengths of family leave are penalised more among single mothers in terms of employment, which increases and reproduces social inequalities. This means that existing inequalities are reinforced by labour market absences supported by leave policies.",

        "abstract": "The Colombian Armed Conflict produced extensive patterns of homicide and enforced disappearance as armed actors employed strategies of terror to assert and consolidate power. Yet family bereavement—one of the most widespread and enduring consequences of such violence—remains critically understudied from a quantitative perspective. This study applies kinship demographic methods to estimate the scale of conflict-attributable bereavement in Colombia across time, with a focus on its population-level prevalence. Using data from the Colombian Truth Commission, adjusted for underreporting, we estimate the number of individuals who have ever experienced the death or enforced disappearance of family members due to conflict-related violence. Results indicate that, by 2018, approximately 7% of Colombians had lost a close family member, while 38% had lost any member of their family. Demographic projections suggest that these effects will persist for decades. The study provides novel insight into the scale, structure, and long-term consequences of kin loss caused by armed conflict. In the Colombian context, it represents a first step toward recognizing that war-induced bereavement was not merely collateral, but a targeted mechanism for dismantling family networks and eroding community cohesion. Our demographic profiling of the bereaved can aid efforts to support survivors and identify victims of enforced disappearance.",

        "abstract": "Happiness studies from around the world find that women report greater happiness than men. Few studies investigate this gap in India, where there are important gender disparities in social, educational, economic, and health outcomes. We use WHO SAGE 2007-08 data to document gaps in self-reported happiness between men and women in middle and later adulthood. We find that women are 5 percentage points more likely to report being “very happy” or “happy” compared to men (0.60 vs. 0.55, p&lt;0.01). We use descriptive figures and regression models to show that the gender gap in reported happiness increases after adjusting for differences in education, self-reported physical health, and paid employment. The fact these covariates correlate with happiness in the expected ways increases the credibility of the data and sharpens the puzzle. This study contributes the most comprehensive documentation to date of the gender gap in reported happiness in India. Considering the widespread and persistent nature of discrimination against women, these results should be interpreted with care. We consider what information future surveys would need to collect to better understand the reasons for these results.",

        "abstract": "Factorial survey experiments are widely used in the social sciences to study decision-making and attitudes through controlled, experimentally manipulated scenarios—typically presented as text. However, textual vignettes may limit the realism of vignettes and participant en-gagement, motivating the search for alternative approaches. This article explores how gener-ative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create photorealistic, customisable images for visual vignettes. It demonstrates techniques for producing and selectively editing images, highlighting their potential addressing the demands of experimental social science research while also addressing key challenges, including ethical considerations, biases inherent in AI tools, and technical limitations. The article showcases potential applications of AI-generated images in social science research and presents survey results on how these images are per-ceived by participants. By critically evaluating both opportunities and challenges, this article provides researchers with practical guidance on integrating AI-generated visuals into factori-al survey experiments, enhancing methodological approaches in the social sciences.",

        "abstract": "Sociologists have an awkward relationship with functionalist explanations. Despite having declared “functionalism” to be obsolete, some form of functionalist argument remains cryptically present in much substantive research. We argue that the inability to talk plainly about functions is a major hindrance for theory building in the discipline. As such, this paper has two goals. The first is disambiguation. What does it mean to attribute a function to something? We answer this question by elaborating on the distinction between proper functions (responding to why-is-it-there questions) and role functions (responding to how-does-it-work questions). The second is to introduce a typology of functional arguments that builds upon this distinction, allowing us to recast “functionalism” as a set of general explanatory strategies and not as a substantive theory about society. Importantly, these strategies are not burdened by the problems of the organicist framework many sociologists have in mind when they disregard functionalist explanations.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This paper examines racial and ethnic differences in fertility, emphasizing the fertility differentials between Asian American women and their counterparts in other racial/ethnic groups. Background: By 2055, Asian Americans will become the largest immigrant group in the United States. The fertility behavior of Asian American women will have significant implications for the future size and composition of the US population. Yet, due to data constraints, little is known about Asian American fertility. Method: This paper analyzes data from the 2022─2023 American Community Survey to compare the odds of having a child in the past year by women’s race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. Results: Fertility differences between Asian American women and those in other racial/ethnic groups were primarily due to differences in non-marital fertility rates. For unmarried women in all groups, having a college degree was associated with lower adjusted odds of having a child during the past 12 months. However, this educational differential was largest among Asian American women. Having a college degree was associated with higher adjusted odds of having a birth for married White, Black, and Hispanic women. Educational differences were minimal among married Asian American women. Conclusion: Asian American women with college degrees display a stronger preference for marriage as the context for childbearing than women in other racial/ethnic and educational groups.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a cognitive sociological account of the emergence of social worlds that organize the expectations of producers and audiences. The proposed model considers the emergence process in three stages. The first stage concerns the arrival of distinctive clusters of objects and their producers. The second involves the conceptualization of the labeled clusters within high-energy social structures that we call scenes. The final stage occurs if and when the concept at the center of the scene becomes generally taken for granted. The first part of the paper develops an ontology for analyzing these processes. The second part analyzes the role of social structure in these stages and defines the emergence process in terms of hazards, the event rates of each stage, which can be modeled in empirical analysis. The proposed account can explain the emergence of worlds in a variety of social contexts, including organizational forms in markets, genres in creative industries, disciplines in science, and forms of social protest.",

        "abstract": "The shift of immigration enforcement to local jurisdictions has intensified localized patterns of anti-immigrant sentiment, enabling the system of mass deportation to expand at an unprecedented scale. This study examines the effects of 287(g) agreements, which empower local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, on Latino residential segregation. Using a quasi-experimental design that compares counties implementing 287(g) with those that applied but did not implement, we find that these policies significantly slowed declines in Hispanic-white segregation, particularly in early-adopting Southern counties where enforcement was most aggressive. We find no evidence that the program altered patterns of segregation for non-Hispanics. Our analysis suggests that these effects are driven by shifts in residential mobility and migration behaviors among Latino households, as enforcement amplified economic vulnerability, fear, and spatial isolation. By demonstrating how immigration enforcement disrupts Latino integration into residential communities, this study reveals the far-reaching consequences of these policies for racial stratification and neighborhood inequality in the United States.",

The research hypothesizes that participatory mapping, led by the communities themselves, strengthens their capacity to claim territorial rights, organize collectively, and negotiate with hegemonic actors. Methodologically, it combines participatory ethnography, insurgent cartography workshops, and network analysis, applied to conflict areas in the state. Expected outcomes include raising awareness that participatory maps make peasant territorialities visible, support public policies, and consolidate solidarity networks.

However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks---via edge simplification and node consolidation---resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.",

        "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) has not broken higher education. It has revealed that much of it was already broken. This paper argues that the dominant educational paradigm, rooted in formalist models of cognition, no longer serves the needs of a world filled with thinking machines. Learning, long reduced to internal recall and reproduction, must be recalibrated as the capacity to act meaningfully, critically, and creatively with tools in real-world contexts. This is not technological determinism. It’s an attempt to reconcile epistemic insolvency accruing compounding interest. Blending epistemological insight with systems-level critique and practical strategies, the paper exposes the reactive militarization between student evasion and faculty surveillance, and it challenges educators to transform traditional classroom activities with authentic, tool-mediated practice. Drawing from the fields of Learning Sciences and Instructional Design, it explores how GenAI can serve not as a threat to integrity, but as a compounding cognitive artifact: a “thought prosthesis,” a support system that amplifies creativity, an accessibility tool, and an enabler of personalized, real-time learning at scale. The paper proposes a Critical AI Literacy agenda grounded in epistemic awareness. This extends to include practical implementation of RAG tutors, Custom GPTs, interactive generators, student-led content production, and code-based learning; all deployed with an honest reckoning of GenAI’s deficits: semiotic fallacy, fabrication, bias, and ethical opacity. The result is a roadmap not only for responsible integration of GenAI in college classrooms, but for reimagining what education can become when human discernment, creativity, and tool fluency are placed at the center. The ideas within do not present GenAI as a savior or a scourge, but as a mirror allowing us to confront what education has become and inviting us to rebuild something better.",
