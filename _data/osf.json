        "abstract": "Elites worldwide have used a variety of indirect tools to exclude specific racial groups from the electorate when laws or constitutions prevented them from doing so directly. Yet because voter registers rarely capture race, how these tools affect the composition of the electorate remains unclear. We contribute foundational micro-evidence from newly digitized archival data for all 135,457 voters registered in the Cape Colony (South Africa) in 1903, including their racial classification. We examine franchise restrictions introduced by Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes a decade earlier, and find they reduced registered voters of color by at least one third relative to white voters, likely shifting crucial election outcomes. Tracing how race, class, and geography intersect at the individual level, we find increased property requirements had the largest impact. This reveals a trade-off between the breadth and precision of different tools of racial disenfranchisement, with consequences for the socioeconomic composition of the electorate.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the data availability policies posted on the websites of a broad collection of political science journals. We code the policies of 221 political science journals, and we find that only 20% of these journals require researchers to share their data and/or code as a condition of publication. While requirements to share data and code are common among the most visible political science journals, these policies remain relatively rare in the discipline more broadly. In prioritizing reforms to improve openness and reproducibility in political science, we suggest remaining mindful of the relative rarity and simple effectiveness of requiring authors to share their data and code.",

        "authors": "Maybritt Jill Alpes",
        "created": "2025-02-08",
        "abstract": "The article examines how academics can mobilize their epistemic resources to engage with justice claims able to challenge border violence. Many migration scholars would like to find ways to mobilize their knowledge to resist migrants’ human rights violations. Despite increased focus on research impact, border violence is only increasing. On the one hand, policy makers do not act on scholarly recommendations that are highly critical, but not necessarily actionable. On the other hand, when scholarly recommendations are actionable, legal and policy changes do not necessarily result in meaningful improvements for refugees’ and other migrants’ dignity. As a result, there is a dichotomy between applied research that is not critical and critical research that is not actionable. Against this backdrop, this article explores how migration researchers can reclaim the meaning of impact and smuggle critique into the term. The article is based on auto-biographical explorations of what it means for an anthropologist to produce knowledge on migration from within law faculties and as policy officer and research consultant for human and refugee rights organizations. Based on this material, the article argues that migration scholars who seek justice should not produce more evidence, but rather take law seriously as a knowledge practice. The article develops three design principles for migration scholars who seek to resist in the short- and medium-term migration laws and policies that violate human right principles. First, build knowledge alliances with justice actors. Second, theorize knowledge needs in justice claims. Third, broker the validity of truth claims.",

        "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
        "created": "2025-02-05",
        "abstract": "Este trabalho investiga como o setor farmacêutico tornou-se um dos maiores e mais influentes setores econômicos da atualidade. Apresenta números e informações que respaldam essa afirmação e busca elucidar os fatores que contribuíram para tal ascensão. Desde a descoberta da penicilina por Alexander Fleming em 1928, as indústrias farmacêuticas evoluíram de pequenas entidades - muitas vezes familiares e de atuação local - para corporações multinacionais avaliadas em centenas de bilhões de dólares com influência global. Entretanto, além da descoberta e diversificação de medicamentos, do aumento da demanda e da expansão da capacidade produtiva, parte dessa evolução é sustentada por estratégias complexas e, em alguns casos, perversas, que priorizam a maximização dos lucros em detrimento da saúde pública e individual. Os achados deste estudo revelam que, nas últimas duas décadas, as receitas do setor quadruplicaram, atingindo 1,48 trilhão de dólares em 2022, um montante comparável ao Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) de países desenvolvidos, como a Espanha. As vinte maiores empresas do setor possuem um valor de mercado combinado de US$ 3,5 trilhões e ativos totalizando US$ 1,86 trilhões, gerando receitas anuais de US$ 820 bilhões e lucros de US$ 181,6 bilhões. Para contextualizar, somente os ativos dessas companhias são comparáveis ao PIB de todos os países da África Subsaariana. Empresas, como a Johnson &amp; Johnson, possuem um valor de mercado que supera o PIB de 184 nações. O estudo também examina e discute práticas questionáveis adotadas pela indústria farmacêutica, incluindo o investimento de bilhões de dólares em lobby e financiamento eleitoral, influência sobre órgãos reguladores, apoio financeiro a organizações de pacientes, patrocínio a autores de \"Diretrizes Clínicas\", manipulação e ocultação de pesquisas e testes de medicamentos, e o direcionamento de investimentos maciços para fortalecer laços com prescritores, hospitais universitários e instituições acadêmicas. São fornecidos exemplos concretos dessas ações, apoiados por estudos, levantamentos de dados e decisões judiciais, que ressaltam as consequências alarmantes desta realidade. Por fim, a pesquisa analisa o marketing farmacêutico como uma das principais estratégias de aumento de vendas. A despeito dos medicamentos não serem mercadorias comuns, suscetíveis à promoção sob a lente do consumo desenfreado, as empresas investem bilhões anualmente em publicidade dirigida diretamente ao consumidor. No contexto brasileiro, o setor farmacêutico destaca-se como um dos principais investidores em marketing. Nos últimos anos, diversas empresas da área figuraram entre os maiores gastos individuais com propaganda. A emergência de estratégias de marketing digital impulsionadas pela internet, algoritmos avançados e redes sociais, junto a campanhas publicitárias nocivas à saúde pública e coletiva, ratificam um cenário preocupante e desafiador.",

        "abstract": "Institutional anomie theory (IAT) posits that religion is a social institution that influences crime, yet religion has been relatively neglected in empirical research on IAT. We elaborate the role of religion within IAT, methodologically differentiate religious traditions, and empirically test hypotheses regarding local religious ecologies and community homicide over time in the U.S. In analyses of county-level panel data, we find that increases in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are directly associated with increases in homicide rates, while increases in the Catholic adherent rate are directly associated with decreases in homicide rates. Using spatial analysis to examine spillover effects from adjacent locations, increases in the Catholic adherent rate and the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with increases in homicide, while increases in the mainline Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with decreases in homicide. The total effect (both direct and indirect) for changes in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate is the largest in the model. In sum, elaborating and extending IAT, this study theorizes and then demonstrates the importance of differentiating between specific religious traditions for understanding spatial and temporal patterns in crime.",

        "authors": "Susanne Garritzmann, Sigrid Roßteutscher, Max P. Jansen, Birgit Becker",
        "created": "2025-02-07",
        "abstract": "Political efficacy is a powerful predictor of political participation. Many traditional measures of efficacy in political science prompt survey respondent to think of “people like me”, thus evoking a group reference. However, without specifying which of multiple possible group memberships respondents ought to think of, answers may refer to completely different groups across respondents, resulting in imprecise measures. In this paper, we argue that political efficacy encompasses not only an internal and an external dimension, but that there also is a third dimension, group-related political efficacy, which reflects variation in degrees of political responsiveness to different groups. To empirically assess our argument, we developed new measures of political efficacy and conducted two large, register-based surveys among different age groups (adolescents and adults) in Germany. The results show that individuals have very different perceptions of group-related political efficacy depending on their educational, economic, and migration backgrounds. With around 30 percent, a significant share of respondents has opposing group-related and external efficacy, suggesting that theoretically and empirically differentiating between these dimensions is important. Based on our evidence, we conclude that a vague stimulus as “people like me” blur the differences between general external and group-related dimensions of political efficacy. Instead, to adequately assess political efficacy, we suggest to use our newly developed (short) scales, specifying the concrete group of reference that the researcher is interested in.",

        "abstract": "Why do citizens support central bank independence (CBI)? Despite important research on economic and political reasons to grant independence to central banks, we know little about what the public thinks about CBI. This is important given citizens' potential role in constraining politicians' ability to alter CBI. We hypothesize that support for CBI is influenced by citizens' limited understanding of central bank governance and their beliefs about who will gain control over monetary policy if independence is reduced. Our expectations are confirmed by a preregistered survey experiment and a pre-post-election test in the U.S. Support for CBI increases when respondents learn that the President would gain more influence if independence was reduced. This support decreases when respondents expect a co-partisan to lead the executive branch. These findings shed light on the legitimacy basis of monetary institutions in politically polarized contexts and, from a policy perspective, indicate the limits of central bank communication.",

        "authors": "Daria Glukhova",
        "created": "2025-02-07",
        "abstract": "This article explores the patterns of political representation by movement parties and their influence on policy-making in a comparative manner by investigating policy successes of four movement parties – two in Germany (AfD, die Grünen) and two in Italy (M5S, Federazione dei Verdi), - against the policy expectations of the social movements they represent. It shows that movement parties can achieve policy influence and help transmit policy demands of their associated social movements into institutions in other ways than through a powerful position in the government or in parliament. This demonstrates that a party does not have to be in a governing coalition to achieve policy success, nor does being in a government coalition at the time of policy adoption ensure policy survival in the long-term. On the contrary, parties in opposition or with low representation in parliament are able to achieve important policy impact, despite their relatively low popularity in the elections prior or following the adoption of a particular policy. Policy success can be attributed to a number of diverse factors: close alignment with the movement, impact on the agenda-setting stage through implicit or explicit influence of the party, cooptation of policy issues by established political parties, and direct participation in policy-making. The latter, however, does not by itself ensure long-term sustainability of the policy success. We elaborate on the implications of this research on theories of democratic representation, coalition governance, and public policy.",

        "authors": "Niall Reddy",
        "created": "2025-02-10",
        "abstract": "A large literature in heterodox political economy addresses an apparent puzzle in which investment has declined while profits have held up during the financialization era. The dominant answer to this puzzle centers on the rise of shareholder value orientation and the “downsizing and distributing” (DD) imperative it imposes on firms. Yet the detailed empirical literature on the topic - focussed on partial effects - pays precious little attention to actual observed patterns of growth, investment and distribution at a firm level. Digging deep into firm level data and correcting several conceptual and measurement errors, this paper challenges several key stylized facts of the financialization account, revealing a different set of patterns which are very difficult to square with stronger versions of DD theory. It shows that the profit-investment puzzle is not a paradox of the financialization era, but only of the post-2000 period. Similarly, the ramping up of payout rates only happens in a broad way after the turn of the millennium. While financialization theories cannot account for the 2000s watershed I argued that a trifecta of other structural shifts can. Ultimately this paper questions the widespread practice of giving analytical priority to financialization in heterodox political economy.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is a densely populated country over 170 million people located in the South Asian region. Over the years, it has achieved impressive advances in health care, education, and poverty alleviation. The implementation of different programs jointly collaborated by international development partners and the Government of Bangladesh has been able to uplift people’s livelihoods. Despite those advances, many challenges still persist, particularly in rural and low-income communities. The lack of trained health care workers, including birth attendants, is one of the most glaring public health challenges. Furthermore, public health issues like maternal and child health is worsened by the fact that many women have not access to modern family planning methods yet. In view of these challenges, Bangladesh carries out the Demographic and Health Survey to gather information related to healthcare services, birth attendance, and family planning, etc. This knowledge allows policymakers and organizations to make informed decisions that can enhance access to healthcare nationwide.",

        "abstract": "Background: Spanish migration sources are widely used by researchers and international organisations. Thus, consistent time-series are crucial. In 2021, the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) replaced the Residential Variation Statistics (EVR) and the Migration Statistics (EM) with the new Change of Residence and Migration Statistics, which included methodological changes. Objective: I evaluate differences between the EMCR and previous sources and produce weights to make the EMCR consistent with the EVR and EM. I publish the weights in an open repository (https://github.com/MiguelGonzalezLeonardo/Weights_EMCR_Spain). Methods: I analyse the percentage differences for internal and international migration between the EMCR and the previous sources at NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 levels in 2021, the only year when the three sources were published simultaneously. I then produce weights by dividing the migration counts from the EVR and EM by those from the EMCR for each spatial unit. Results: I found strong differences between the new source and the previous sources for international migration, especially for emigration, which needs to be calibrated with the weights. The EMCR and EVR register similar numbers of internal migrants. Conclusions: Methodological changes in statistical sources can lead to large differences in the measurement of a social phenomenon. This suggests the need to assess time-series consistency and produce weights for calibration. Contribution: I provide open data with weights to calibrate internal and international migration in the new Spanish migration source and produce consistent time-series with previous sources at different scales. The weights can be used by researchers from different countries and international organisations.",

The paper studies adaptation along two margins: changes in crop choices, and reallocation of workers across sectors. Using long-term data on cyclones and flooding in Bangladesh, I find that the increase in propensity of both cyclones and floods affect crop choice, but only cyclones affect sectoral employment, shifting employment out of agriculture. The paper develops a structural model to study the welfare implications of adaptation and calculate the Value of adaptation i.e. how much worse welfare would be if both adaptation channels were shut off. I find that the Value of adaptation is informed by the nature of the shocks: both the intensity of future shocks and their correlatedness across crops and regions influence the Value of adaptation. The Value of adaptation is 20% in the case in which intensity of both flooding and cyclones doubles relative to the 2000s average, and such increases are correlated within regions.",

This shift is driven by the economic feasibility of technologies such as solar and wind power. However, the transition to renewable energy faces significant obstacles: its lower energy density compared to fossil fuels requires larger structures to produce equivalent amounts of energy. Additionally, these sources have a shorter lifespan than conventional ones, leading to increased demand for minerals, which are often extracted in Global South countries. This dynamic may exacerbate the socio-environmental conflicts and impacts associated with mining.

        "abstract": "Calorie labeling is a popular policy to address the obesity epidemic, but it has had little empirical success. Under the premise that willful avoidance of information plays a role in this result, we propose a novel approach—pre-nudges—to make consumers more receptive to calorie information. Unlike nudges, which are used to directly influence a choice, pre-nudges are used to directly influence how consumers react to the nudge itself (the calorie label). In line with predictions from our theoretical analysis, we test two pre-nudges in the context of menu labeling: one aims to increase self-efficacy, and the other one highlights the long-term health risks of overeating. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, we find that both pre-nudges reduce calorie information avoidance. Overall, our paper suggests a possible role for pre-nudges in addressing the obesity epidemic—one of the largest public health issues globally—and illustrates the potential usefulness of pre-nudges more generally",

        "abstract": "Current research on education reform has focused chiefly on positive shocks that intend to equalize educational opportunity, while negative shocks that impede school access have rarely been investigated. What would happen to someone exposed simultaneously to both types of shocks? I tackle this question in the context of Vietnam, where a universal primary education reform (a positive shock) and an introduction of tuition fee for secondary education (a negative shock) took place within a short time but affected different cohorts. Analyses of census data suggest four key findings. (1) The negative shock decreased individual years of schooling, whereas the positive shock increased it. (2) The beneficial effect of the positive shock predominates over the adverse effect of the negative shock, resulting in an overall improvement in educational attainment for those exposed to both shocks. (3) The favorable joint effect on schooling is more pronounced for socioeconomically disadvantaged rural residents, women, and ethnic minorities. (4) The two shocks together enhanced intergenerational educational persistence, but their effects on labor market outcomes are complex.",

        "abstract": "We examined the extent to which the socioeconomic status (SES) of grandchildren’s families (measured by parental education and household income) is associated with the frequent child care help and financial support grandparents channel towards their descendants. Several studies have shown that (i) grandparental investment varies according to gender and lineage, and (ii) differences in family relationships tend to exist between lower and higher SES families. However, there is a lack of studies examining whether grandparents invest more in grandchildren from lower or higher SES families in contemporary affluent societies, and whether this differs between maternal and paternal grandmothers and grandfathers. We used population-based data on younger and middle-aged adults from Germany. To study the associations between family SES and grandparental investment, we applied generalized ordered logit odds models. Grandparents provided frequent childcare help more often to grandchildren whose parents had higher levels of education and income. Specifically, frequent childcare help from maternal grandmothers increased as parental education levels rose. Additionally, paternal grandparents provided more financial support to families in the medium, high, and highest income classes compared to those in the lowest income class. There was evidence that grandparents invest more in grandchildren from higher SES families than in those from lower SES families. The findings suggest that grandparental support may widen the inequality between advantaged and disadvantaged children.",

        "abstract": "The role of bibliometric indicators in research assessment has been widely debated. This article explores how citation-based metrics are interpreted and applied in negative habilitation reviews, combining theoretical insights on citation practices with empirical analysis of review discourse. The theoretical section examines different conceptual frameworks for understanding bibliometric indicators, including essentialist, constructivist, and normative perspectives on citations. It highlights how citation metrics are often assumed to reflect recognition, influence, or research quality, despite growing evidence of their contextual limitations. The empirical section analyzes 174 negative habilitation reviews from four disciplines, identifying distinct patterns in how reviewers incorporate bibliometric data into their assessments. While some reviewers treat citation counts and journal rankings as direct indicators of scholarly impact, others regard them as secondary or complementary tools that require careful contextualization. The findings reveal a lack of standardized bibliometric reasoning, leading to inconsistencies in how candidates’ research contributions are evaluated. The study underscores the need for greater transparency and theoretical awareness in the use of citation-based metrics in peer review, contributing to broader discussions on the reliability and standardization of research evaluation practices.",

        "abstract": "Norris and Inglehart's (2019) cultural backlash theory has become popular for understanding right-wing backlash. The theory views backlash as a reaction from segments of the population who feel alienated by advancing societal liberalization. We test this core claim of the theory by investigating whether highly educated individuals increasingly adopted more liberal attitudes toward immigrants, LGTBIQ+ rights, and gender roles over recent decades across European countries, and whether this has led to an increasing liberalization gap to lower educated segments of the population. Using data from the European Values Study (1980–2020) and the European Social Survey (2001–2021) we find that liberalization dynamics vary significantly across countries and attitudinal indicators. Growing liberalization gaps are most common in Central and Eastern European countries, particularly in a distinct and pronounced way concerning LGTBIQ+ attitudes. Western Europe shows fewer gaps, mostly in isolated attitudes on immigration and gender roles. We conclude that cultural backlash theory is most applicable to Central and Eastern Europe (and to some extent in Southern Europe). In most countries, explaining backlash through this lens requires acknowledging that growing liberalization gaps occur on singular attitudes rather than being a widespread phenomenon.",

Proximity to greenspace has been suggested as an important resource for physical activity. This study aimed to examine associations between proximity to greenspaces and objectively and subjectively measured physical activity. Participants came from the Millennium Cohort Study (n=9,873). Participant postcodes were linked to nearest greenspace access points and network distance calculated for real-world walking routes. We found that greater distance to greenspace of any size was associated with a small increase in subjective, but not objective, physical activity at age 14. Further analysis showed that &gt;30 minutes walking time to closest greenspace, compared to &lt;5 minutes, was associated with increased self-reported and device-measured physical activity. No associations were observed for &gt;5 and &lt;30 minutes compared to &lt;5 minutes. Results suggest that proximity to greenspace alone may not be sufficient to promote physical activity participation in adolescents. Future studies should include measures of quality and perceptions of greenspaces.",

We conducted a survey of 505 California farmers and ranchers affected by wildfires between 2017 and 2023. Main findings show that wildfires’ impacts on producers are extensive and range from mild to catastrophic, with both short and long-term repercussions, regardless of their exposure level. Producers play a central role in community emergency wildfire risk response and management by reducing fuel loads, creating defensible space, and leveraging their fire management expertise for themselves and their neighbors. Many producers lack a robust financial safety net, particularly among vulnerable populations, pointing to the need to increase access to recovery resources including insurance and disaster assistance programs. We find an urgent need for policy reforms, improved support, targeted extension programs, and integrated coordination mechanisms. Producers are our overlooked allies in building widespread wildfire resilience. Enhanced collaborative efforts among producers, fire professionals, and agricultural support organizations are thus imperative to co-create and implement strategies that ensure the long-term sustainability and economic viability of California’s agricultural communities.",

Drawing on affective polarization research, we highlight the central role of identification and emotions in shaping political in-groups and out-groups. Moving beyond conventional measures of cross-group resentment, we conceptualize polarization as the lived experience of political antagonism. We argue that polarization materializes through struggles for recognition, shaped by the perception and processing of political conflict as it circulates through public communication channels. Adopting a performance-theoretical lens, we connect the symbolic language, emotions, and misrecognition in micropolarization to the broader public drama of political conflict. Using interview data on family and friendship disputes related to COVID-19 vaccination denial in the UK and Germany, we examine how public conflicts manifest in interpersonal relationships. This study suggests a research agenda that explores interactional dynamics across online and offline spaces, diverse social groups, and varying levels of relational involvement, offering a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of political polarization.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines gender differences in paid work over time and illustrates the pitfalls encountered by any comparative research that only considers either labor force participation rates or average working hours. To do so, we analyze harmonized survey data from Europe and the United States from 1992 to 2022 (N=43,283,172) and show that more progress was made in closing gender gaps in labor force participation rates than in working hours. In most countries, women’s labor force participation rates increased considerably, but their average working hours decreased, whereas both men’s labor force participation rates and average working hours decreased or stagnated (but nonetheless still remained much higher than women’s). We show and argue that these countervailing trends in working hours and labor force participation rates make it difficult to paint a coherent picture of cross-national differences in women’s and men’s paid work and of changes over time. In response, we propose “work volume” as a supplementary or alternative measure for any type of comparative research. Work volume records zero working hours for nonemployed individuals and thus allows straightforward comparisons between women’s and men’s (or any other groups’) involvement in paid work. Using the proposed work volume measure, we show that gender gaps in paid work decreased over time, but that even in 2022, men’s involvement in paid work remained considerably higher than women’s—with gender gaps being lowest in the Scandinavian and the former Communist countries.",

Building on the migrants’ trajectories and reasonings, we propose a clearer conceptual delineation of the notions of hope and expectation than the ones that currently prevail in anthropology. We do so by showing their interrelations and articulations, particularly in one’s own experience (constituted by moments of expectation and moments of hope), and by drawing attention to our interlocutors’ temporalisation. As a future-orientation, ‘hope’ is directed toward change and constitutes an envisioning more open and creative than ‘expectation’, which builds on continuity and stability. The notion of ‘duration’ provides insight into the ways our interlocutors compartmentalise their time experience, constituting a sense of past-ness, present-ness, and future-ness, which impacts their future imaginings as ‘hoping’ versus ‘expecting’.",

        "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the current of queer theory has flown through various departments and disciplines. Following its intellectual roots in post-structuralism, queer theory has proven its worth for investigation on the subjects of sexuality, especially in art and humanities. However, queer theory’s influences in other academic fields, such as social sciences and biomedical science, are given less attention. In particular, the relationship between queer theory and sociology past and now need to be revisited: (1) How has sociology, well-known for its epistemological pluralism, responded to the queer theoretical interventions? (2) How has the poststructural critique inspired, contributed to, or challenged sociological scholarship? (3) How do such interactions differ between the center and the periphery of global academic? To answer these questions, I dived into the academic archives looking for clues by close-reading the seminal queer sociological works from the 1990s to the present, and tracing the genealogy of interaction between the two disciplines. Given the radical roots of sociology, such as Marxism and critical theory, we may assume that queer theory and sociology enjoy a considerable affinity. However, the relationship between the two is indeed indeterminate and often comes into tension or confrontation. I divided the developments into three periods and identified the major conceptual themes in each period. Finally, I conclude this article with the remarks and future directions illuminated by this genealogical investigation of queer sociology. My aim for this article is to serve as a map for prospective students and scholars of queer theory and sociology to navigate the intellectual landscape of queer sociology.",

        "abstract": "This paper originally investigates intergenerational wealth inequalities across European countries over the past two decades. Employing a modified socioeconomic attainment model, we identify three primary micro level channels linking social origin to offspring wealth attainment: education, income, and wealth transfers. These channels can be scaled up at the country level to capture the structure of intergenerational rigidities. Empirically, the study examines how wealth stratification by social origin can be predicted by intergenerational rigidities in education, income, and wealth transfers. Aggregate intergenerational measures are computed leveraging about 600,000 individual observations from 31 European countries in 3 points in time (2005, 2011, 2019) from EU-SILC data, with parental education serving as the measure of social origin. Complementing previous single country studies, our findings reveal that wealth attainment is substantially stratified by parental education in most, if not in all, European countries. Moreover, its cross-country and cross-temporal heterogeneity is consistently predicted by intergenerational rigidities in education, income, and wealth transfers. This study contributes to the comparative literature on wealth inequality by underscoring its strong interconnection with established origin-related inequalities in socioeconomic attainment.",

I document the significant positive impacts of the program, not only on the long-term integration of refugees into the healthcare system but also on the health of the next generation. The program improves the cumulative use of primary care services for 12 years after arrival by 44%. This increase is proposed to partially work through refugees’ increased labor market attachment and economic success. The program also results in spillover benefits for the health at birth of the children of refugees with 21–49% decreases in premature birth, low birth weight, and short birth length. These intergenerational effects probably operate via significant improvements in the home environment and maternal care during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Census Bureau is prohibited from collecting data on religion on mandatory surveys. Thus, religious responses on open-ended questions, like ancestry, are encoded as \"other.\" Utilizing American Community Survey (ACS) 2018-2022 data (n = 15,721,123), I find that the 1.49 million Americans with an \"other\" ancestry display remarkable parallels with American Jews, the country's largest religious minority, according to non-governmental survey data. They are disproportionately concentrated in regions with large Jewish populations, exhibit a linguistic profile (e.g., prevalence of Yiddish and Hebrew) consistent with American Jews, and display demographic characteristics (age structure, educational attainment, and racial/ethnic composition) much more in line with Jews than the general U.S. population. These findings suggest that Jews likely comprise a significant portion of those with \"other\" ancestry on the ACS, yet a majority of the 7.63 million Jews in the U.S. do not report this information. This poses important questions on defining Jewish identity in the U.S. today, especially since the ACS ancestry question may be eliminated and subsumed into the new combined race/ethnicity question under statistical policy directive 15. This is the first study on ACS data analyzing the \"other\" ancestry category and assessing its congruence with the American Jewish population.",

        "created": "2025-02-04",
        "abstract": "Start-up founders often face the challenge of pitching their ventures to a heterogeneous audience, with varying expectations and values. In the early 21st century, start-up pitches have become increasingly complex, with the value of start-ups no longer conceived solely in economic terms, but also in moral, social, and environmental ones. This chapter explores how a start-up, presenting its value through \"sustainability,\" navigates these multiple valuations during its pitch. Drawing on Goffman’s dramaturgical framework, Muniesa and Helgesson’s concept of \"spectacles of valuation,\" and Asdal et al.’s concept of \"the good economy,\" I coin the concept of \"the spectacle of the good economy\" to describe how start-up pitches function as public performances where valuation takes place between entrepreneurs and their audiences. Through an analysis of the pitch of a start-up (pseudonym: SoilSight) at a major agricultural trade fair, the chapter examines how material and semiotic elements of the pitch—particularly the \"pitch deck\" and the entrepreneur’s performance on stage—contribute to a valuation of the start-up as \"sustainable,\" understood as a hybrid value that combines both economic and more-than-economic (social, moral, environmental) elements. By extending Peircean semiotics to the analysis of pitch performances, the chapter contributes to the understanding of how the good economy is staged, negotiated, and redefined in contemporary start-up culture.",

Al igual que un amplio conjunto de chilenas y chilenos, nos hemos conmocionado al rememorar los cruentos efectos de la persecución política impulsada por la dictadura, en especial en espacios educativos, la cual hasta el día de hoy tiene profundos efectos en la vida democrática de las instituciones de educación superior, y por ende, en la integridad psíquica de sus trabajadores, trabajadoras, y de cada uno de sus estamentos. El paso del tiempo, los procesos judiciales contra los victimarios, y las políticas de verdad, justicia y reparación no han sido suficientes para permitir la completa recuperación de condiciones mínimas para constituir espacios seguros de educación superior, en tanto sigan albergando en sus equipos a personas que hayan ingresado y/o hayan actuado al amparo de un régimen que se valió de las peores armas, para hacer desaparecer a numerosos de sus miembros: docentes, estudiantes, trabajadores y trabajadoras, transformándose en cómplices activos de su persecución, detención y desaparición; dejando una huella indeleble en las comunidades educativas. Esta herida se agudiza más aún cuando, en total impunidad, se les ha otorgado alta capacidad de decisión, o se les permite acceder a cargos de poder.

Aim: To achieve this, we will introduce, explain, and provide examples of how we devised and applied the role of the ‘in-place research coordinator’ within our research between a large university and a large NHS Trust. Discussion: The success of this large inter-organisational research project relied on building positive partnerships and networks over three years. Recognising the challenges of working across different organisations, we created a role for a nurse to serve as an 'in-place research coordinator'. By recruiting directly from the NHS Trust, this coordinator brought valuable organisational insights to the research team whilst gaining research experience through applying their professional knowledge and connections. Conclusion: This paper details, using practical examples, how the role of an ‘in-place’ research coordinator made this interorganisational research happen with measurable efficacy and impact.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the interplay between gender, communication styles, and professional outcomes. Drawing from extant literature on gender stereotypes and their impact on workplace communication, as well as literature on hierarchies and the organization of knowledge in production, I posit that linguistic elaboration, a communication trait more commonly associated with women, obtains different associations in certain workplace contexts. In particular, due to the greater use of elaboration in down-rank communication, this linguistic quality becomes associated with higher status within knowledge-intensive organizations. Consequently, within such contexts, women’s use of elaboration in communication becomes paradoxically gender-incongruent, and penalized accordingly (e.g., accusations of “talking bossy”). Leveraging natural language processing techniques on two distinct datasets – email exchanges within a technology firm and job application essays – I uncover compelling evidence of gender disparities. While both men and women engage in elaborate communication, women non-managers disproportionately face negative consequences, particularly when communicating upward to managers. These penalties persist even controlling for message content and communication patterns, suggesting a status violation mechanism rather than efficiency standards. These findings contribute to organizational theory by illuminating the context-dependent nature of gender-congruent communication and its divergent effects on career advancement.",

This report also provides options on how solidarity can be fostered through educational policies and practices. Among other aspects of the complexity surrounding solidarity, this report discusses the levels, longitudinal variation, and relevance as a political desideratum in democratic societies. This report also examines how solidarity relates to other sociological and psychological concepts, such as social identity, altruism, and social norms. Findings indicate the need to look at intergenerational solidarity and the salience of solidarity in discussions concerning the welfare state, the economy, migration, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, to cite some current concerns that are high on public and political agendas. In education, we find that instilling the value of European solidarity, among other common values, is key for the European integration project. We therefore recommend pursuing policies to foster solidarity at all levels and, with particular reference to Education in particular, to include solidarity education in school curricula in support of the promotion of European values.",

        "abstract": "Michael Apple señalaba en su libro “¿Puede la educación cambiar la sociedad?” (sugerente título no?), lo siguiente (cito): “Sería muy erróneo considerar a las escuelas como distintas de la «sociedad». Como lugares de trabajo remunerado, son partes integrantes de la economía. Como lugares de trabajo diferenciados, reconstituyen (y a veces desafían) las jerarquías de clase, género, raza y «capacidad». Como instituciones que históricamente han servido como motores de movilidad de clase”. Entonces, bajo la lúcida mirada de Apple, no existe una barrera clara entre la educación y la sociedad, sino que se trata de un sistema (vital para la humanidad) que da soporte a la vida social. A partir de ello, para abordar los problemas educativos, no podemos hacer otra cosa que intentar comprender los problemas sociales, y abordarlos de forma conjunta. Más aún, Apple señala cómo en zonas de guerra, como lo fue Sarajevo, o como puede ocurrir hoy en Gaza o el Líbano, las personas seguían levantando escuelas para sus hijos a fin de mantener su pasado vivo y construir un futuro mejor. Miembros de la comunidad, activistas, maestros, estudiantes y muchos más se movilizarán y sacrificarán colectivamente para crear instituciones educacionales sensibles, incluso en condiciones destructivas y desastrosas. Una vez más, aquí hay una palabra clave: colectivamente. En el caso de Chile, nuestras crisis sociales se anclan en un sistema de acumulación que, al igual que es capaz de erigir rascacielos en Sanhattan, y elevar el nivel de vida de ciertos barrios a niveles de países de primer mundo, su sombra parece alargarse por un vasto y extenso territorio, tal como sucede durante el ocaso, cuando las sombras de los rascacielos se alargan hasta lo impensado. Según Apple, se podría resistir el ataque del neoliberalismo a partir de las identidades colectivas y a las experiencias educativas arraigadas en la defensa y recreación de tales identidades. El problema sería entonces definir quiénes somos (como país, como comunidades, o pueblos), o más aún, quienes queremos ser. Al parecer, responder una pregunta de ese calibre puede desorientar hasta al más experimentado paciente de una buena psicoterapia. Ello podría ejemplificar cómo el arduo debate se desarrolló en el caso de la educación en el reciente debate constitucional, motivado por lo que conocimos como un \"estallido social\", o para algunos, \"la revuelta social\", proceso que si bien no resulto del todo fructífero en términos políticos, nos permitió constatar el potencial y la magnitud de las crisis sociales que han ido gestando en nuestro modelo de desarrollo económico, territorial y educativo.",

Economic instability, violence, mental health issues, and environmental vulnerability are all interconnected issues that exacerbate the socio-economic challenges women face in their day-to-day lives. Eventually, it makes women more vulnerable to developing non-communicable diseases. Objective: This study aims to establish causal links between poverty, gender disparity, and NCD risks in women. It is one of the first studies to execute machine learning techniques to explore the relationship between gender disparity and NCD mortality among Bangladeshi women. The paper evaluates the multidimensional aspect of gender norms that strain women's health. Methodology: data analysis was done using a synthetic dataset generated using GAN that mimics real-world datasets. OLS, random forest, lasso regression, and XGboost were employed for assessing research objectives. Results: The primary results identify income level as the main predictor of NCD mortality. Unemployment rate, unpaid domestic labor, and high stress levels are the secondary predictors. Conclusion: Addressing economic, socioeconomic, and cultural oppression is crucial for improving the country's health. The government and policymakers need to introduce gendered health policies to improve health equity in Bangladesh.",

Our results point to an intersectional mechanism; students are significantly less likely to select classes led by a teacher of the opposite gender and ethnicity, implying that the students’ same-sex bias primarily affects ethnic minority teachers. While the ethnicity bias is robust to default nudging, elevating the opposite gender as the default option reduces or even eliminates the selection bias. We also show that, due to these student preferences, underrepresented teachers may receive significantly weaker students under standard admission systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the crucial role of teacher professional development (TPD) in the successful implementation of curriculum reforms in Sierra Leone's secondary schools. It critically examines how ongoing TPD initiatives influence teachers’ ability to adopt and effectively deliver newly designed curricula that align with global educational standards. The study evaluates the current state of TPD programs in Sierra Leone, including their strengths and weaknesses, and provides recommendations for improvement. Through interviews with educators, policymakers, and curriculum developers, the research highlights the impact of TPD on the quality of education and its contribution to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) in Sierra Leone. The findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, context-sensitive professional development programs to equip teachers with the skills necessary for successful curriculum implementation.",

We are looking at five examples through a common lens. The examples are: the phenomena of ethnic segregation; the fate of street protests; the relations of redistribution, growth, and inequality; fragmentation and polarization of attitudes, and the evolution of filter bubbles. A special focus is put on the description of the generative mechanisms using simple models that can be used online and the distinction of mechanisms of type I (which govern the behavior of individuals and institutions) and type II (which govern the emergence of new systemic properties). Finally, five extensions of the simple models are discussed, which demonstrate different research directions that can be taken in exploring and developing social theory.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the development of professional advocacy in the United Kingdom (UK) nursing and midwifery professions. Initially established in midwifery, the discourse of professional advocacy has gradually shifted from a patient focus to advocating for the professionals in their professional roles. This move is driven by the need to influence the health, well-being, and efficacy of the health professions, thereby positively impacting patient care. The concept of advocacy is thus expanding from advocacy focussing on patients/social groups, to incorporating advocating for health professionals by health professionals. However, it is unclear if literature and evidence is keeping pace with this potential conceptual shift taking place in the practice setting, and it is unclear if past patient-centred conceptualisations of advocacy are relevant to the context of professional-orientated advocacy. This paper aims to initiate this discussion specific to the nursing profession.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenon of delayed retirement in Sierra Leone, focusing on the underlying socio-political and economic factors that contribute to this trend. Given the insecurity and instability in many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, older workers are increasingly choosing to remain in the workforce well beyond traditional retirement age. The study delves into the challenges posed by high unemployment rates, inadequate social security systems, and the need for income security. Through qualitative interviews with government officials, retirees, and economists, this research identifies key reasons for delayed retirement and evaluates its impact on both the labor market and the broader economy. The findings underscore the importance of developing comprehensive retirement policies and systems to support an aging workforce and improve economic security in the region.",

These processes are crucial in sociology and other social sciences, as they study how individuals, families, or organizations change over time or engage in different activities in one or more domains. SA allows for effectively describing and visualizing these temporal processes, helping identify regularities or anomalies in the number, duration, or timing of events and states. These patterns can be linked to units' characteristics (e.g., gender) or contextual factors (e.g., policy changes). The chapter outlines the main steps in conducting SA: coding and visualizing sequences, calculating dissimilarities, clustering similar sequences, and using cluster membership in regression models. This \"core program\" is demonstrated using data from the German pairfam survey. The chapter also provides references to recent advances and concludes with a discussion on challenges and open questions in the field.",

Through qualitative interviews with 42 affected stakeholders, we identified influences across ten TDF domains. Perceived benefits included early family completion, religious fulfillment, and prestige, while harms encompassed health complications, mental health issues, and social stigma. Domains influencing these perceptions were beliefs about consequences, social influences, environmental context, and social/professional identity. Parents emerged as primary decision-makers, influenced by cultural and socioeconomic factors.

        "abstract": "The use of survey-experimental research with online access panels provided by marketing research companies has grown significantly in the social sciences. These panels offer rapid access to quota-representative samples, enabling generalizable findings alongside causal inferences. However, researchers face a wide range of pricing options, with higher-priced companies often claiming superior quality in terms of respondent attentiveness, honesty, and representativity beyond quota characteristics. This creates a potential trade-off between sample quality and the statistical power achievable within a given research budget. Our study examines this trade-off within the context of Germany, the largest economy in Europe. We solicited bids from all marketing research companies operating in the German market to conduct survey-experimental research. From these, we selected three companies representing low, medium, and high price points, each corresponding to self-reported panel quality. Using identical vignette, priming, and conjoint experiments, along with standard socio-demographic and attitudinal measures relevant to political behavior research, we compared the outcomes across these quota-representative samples. Our findings suggest that for experimental designs, the trade-off between price and quality is less pronounced than commonly assumed. Based on this evidence, we recommend prioritizing statistical power by minimizing costs per respondent.",

Using the Web of Science, we analyzed the historical evolution of this trend and its geography, showing that it has been particularly concentrated in a few countries at different periods of time. Then, we evaluated how title changes have affected the evolution of the journals’ language of publication, authorship, readership and impact. The acceleration of the trend towards the de-nationalization and anglicization of journal titles coincided with the rise of discourses on internationalization in the 1980s and the growing use, a decade later, of quantitative indicators in research evaluation, above all the Impact Factor. In general, this rebranding strategy of scholarly journals resulted in a higher visibility on the global market of scientific publications, leading to a more internationalized authorship and readership, but to the detriment of the use of national languages.",

        "abstract": "Tourism has become a vital driver for economic growth and cultural exchange in Tamil Nadu, particularly in rural areas where traditional customs and livelihoods coexist with increasing visitor numbers(N. et al., 2024). This study employs qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations, to assess the socio-cultural and economic effects of tourism on rural communities. Findings reveal that while tourism generates economic benefits such as increased income and job creation, it also presents challenges like seasonal fluctuations and over-reliance on the industry. Socio-culturally, tourism fosters cultural interaction and empowers marginalized groups, especially women, through entrepreneurship. However, concerns arise regarding the erosion of traditional values and customs. Environmental impacts are evident, with increased pressure on natural resources and infrastructure, although eco-tourism initiatives have spurred conservation efforts. The study underscores the need for community-focused and sustainable tourism frameworks that align economic benefits with cultural preservation and environmental sustainability. Inclusive policies that engage local stakeholders in decision-making are essential for ensuring tourism development aligns with community priorities and long-term sustainability.",

Here we apply a novel systematic review method to non-academic (‘grey’) literature coupled with natural language processing and social network analysis to identify trends in biodiversity finance terminology, actors and networks between 2000 to 2022. Our results illustrate the recent explosion in biodiversity finance grey literature since 2020, and increased prevalence of financial over conservation terminology. Text analysis shows the frequency with which mechanisms for generating private investment in nature are mentioned is greatly disproportionate to estimates of their current and projected role in overall biodiversity financing. Our findings highlight the growth in number and diversity of biodiversity finance actors over time, while also pointing to the centrality of a powerful few in driving financialised discourses.",

        "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage points higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed their pension in early 2023. In this study, we assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension take-up using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. We also analyse differences in responses by socioeconomic status and gender. The extraordinary pension index adjustment increased the probability of claiming the partial old-age pension in the first month after becoming eligible for it by around 8 percentage points, or around 80 per cent. The effect is explained by individuals claiming a pension sooner than they would have in the absence of the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

        "abstract": "Federal agencies are directed, as a matter of U.S. Federal policy, to provide free, immediate public access to peer-reviewed scholarly publications that are produced with support from Federal research grant funding. Because copyright vests in the author of the work, agencies must have permission from the author in order to provide that access. A government-wide regulation, in place since 1976, constitutes one possible source for the needed permission. The “Federal Purpose License” provides that, as a condition of Federal funding, grant recipients issue the granting agency a non-exclusive license to use all works subject to copyright and either developed or acquired under the grant. The License allows the agency to “reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes and to authorize others to do so.” The License is functionally the same as other license agreements between parties. As a first priority license, the Federal Purpose License survives all subsequent copyright transfers, allowing authors to comply with grant terms and agencies to comply with their public access mandates. The License provides familiar language and consistency across agencies, helping simplify the compliance and subsequent publication process for grant recipients. The License allows the agency to make many uses, and also allows the agency to authorize third parties to do so, but it is also constrained. The scope of the License depends on the meaning of “Federal Purposes,” which is undefined but is likely tied to the purposes underlying the License itself to support research and provide the public with a return on its investment. Agencies desiring more permissive language may supplement the License with their own regulations, and some have done so.",
