        "abstract": "While partisan gerrymandering has been found to be widespread for Congressional redistricting in the United States, there exists little empirical research on legislative redistricting in other countries. We investigate the partisan bias of Japanese redistricting. Some scholars have argued that the prominent role played by the non-partisan commission leaves little room for partisan gerrymandering. Others have pointed out, however, that the Japanese redistricting process may be subject to political influence. The members of the redistricting commission must be appointed by the Prime Minister and be approved by the Diet. In addition, the commission invites the governors of all prefectures to provide their opinions regarding districting. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to estimate the partisan bias of the 2022 Japanese Lower House redistricting plans. We apply a state-of-the-art redistricting simulation algorithm to generate a large number of alternative non-partisan redistricting plans. The sampled plans are representative of the population of plans and are consistent with the redistricting rules with which the commission must comply. By comparing the enacted plan with this non-partisan baseline, we quantify the extent to which the enacted plan favors a particular party. Unlike the traditional methods, our simulation approach accounts for political geography and redistricting rules specific to each prefecture. Our analysis shows that the Japanese redistricting process yields little partisan bias both at the prefecture and district levels.",

        "abstract": "Expert institutions are increasingly expected not only to provide the best professional expertise but also to ensure equal presence of women. Yet while there is an extensive literature on descriptive gender representation in bureaucracies and courts, we largely lack studies that examine patterns of women’s presence on expert advisory bodies. Drawing on large-n data on the composition of Norwegian expert advisory commissions, the paper investigates and evaluates how the share of women on these commissions has developed over the last half-century. It finds that while overall gender parity was achieved in recent decades, women remain strongly under-represented among commission chairs, particularly academic chairs, and among commission members from economics, an especially important policy discipline. Normatively speaking, the developments towards parity are promising, and we find no empirical confirmation of the worry that proportional representation and competence requirements are in tension. On the contrary, persistent gender gaps among economists on commissions and academic chairs may endanger adequate provision of expertise into policy-making.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This study examines educational heterogeneity in the impact of parental separation on educational attainment, considering the full sequence of childhood family structural changes. Background: Studies have consistently associated parental separation with lower socioeconomic achievement. However, the underlying causes remain unclear, possibly due to self-selection or continued instability in the family environment. Method: This study employs structural causal modeling and Bayesian logistic regression to investigate the causal effect of childhood family structural changes on adult educational attainment using Finnish full-population register data (n = 272,962), focusing on cohorts born in 1987–1991 and their family members. Results: A substantial portion of the 17-percentage-point disadvantage of children from separated families was due to the selection of families into separation and further structural changes. Separation effects followed a U-shaped pattern, with the largest negative effects among families in the middle of the educational gradient. Stepparents did not exert positive or negative effects, except for highly educated parents’ children benefiting from stable stepfathers. Recurring family instability had the largest negative impact. Conclusion: The curvilinear relationship between parental and child education may partly explain the mixed results of previous studies. Implications: Given that recurring family instability was shown to be the most detrimental to children’s educational attainment, low-threshold guidance and support to aspiring and existing blended families might have the largest impacts on children of separated parents.",

        "abstract": "This work aims to characterize the segregation of Research Support Staff (RSS) in CONICET Argentina by gender, area of ​​knowledge and others characteristics through the request for public data of this personnel. It was determined that in August 2024, there are 2,931 active support staff working in 348 Institutes, and the amount of RSS assigned to each institution varies between 1 and 47. The institutes with the largest number of support staff by area of ​​knowledge are: the INTEMA (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencia y Tecnología de Materiales) in the KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences) with 47 RSS, followed by the MACNBR (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) in the KB area with 42 RSS, the CADIC (Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas) in the KE area with 38 RSS, and in the KS area there are two institutes that compete to be in first place with 14 RSS, which are: the CEIL (Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Laborales) and the CAICYT (Centro Argentino de Información Científica y Tecnológica). Regarding gender segregation by area of ​​knowledge, the feminized areas are: KB (Biological and Health Sciences), KS (Social Sciences and Humanities) and the masculinized areas: KA (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences); KE (Exact and Natural Sciences) and Not Applicable. The KT (Technology) area does not count any RSS personnel. It's curious that for the case of KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences), the trend found for CONICET researchers is not reproduced by RSS because for them it is feminized, making it necessary to investigate the reasons for this deeply. The two areas with the largest number of support personnel assigned are KE: Exact and Natural Sciences; being masculinized, and KB: Biological and health sciences, being feminized. This analysis is a contribution to comprehension of the characteristics of CONICET's teem infrastructure roles, in order to advance the understanding of their work problems and barriers to professional growth.",

        "abstract": "Parental leave uptake by fathers represents one pathway to redress the typically unequal division of early childcare. Following the Nordic schema, the Finnish leave system is designed around this concept to encourage leave uptake, but a substantial share of fathers refrain from it. Though there is a substantial body of literature on policy and individual-level motivators of leave uptake, the decision to take leave often occurs in the context of the workplace. Workplace factors are often cited as typical barriers to uptake. We systematically investigated how the most important workplace characteristics are associated with fathers’ parental leave decisions. We used administrative, linked employee-employer Finnish register data and a multilevel Bayesian approach to examine employed first-time fathers’ use of the father’s quota in 2013–2017. Contrary to our expectations, the probability of taking father’s quota did not vary by the gender composition of or gender wage gap within the workplace. Workplace educational level was important, but only for tertiary educated fathers. Increased competitiveness of the workplace lowered the probability of taking the quota. Our findings call for further study on the interplay of individual and contextual factors in fathers’ parental leave uptake.",

        "abstract": "Several states have set goals to increase the number of college graduates, leading to accountability measures that incorporate college preparatory (prep) coursework. However, access to these courses varies within and across school contexts, potentially shaping students’ educational trajectories. This study examines access to college prep courses in Texas, exploring how school characteristics predict course offerings and how these offerings predict course-taking. We also determine whether college prep course-taking affects postsecondary attainment within 12 years of high-school graduation. Results show that larger, urban, and suburban schools with higher academic achievement and less economic disadvantage offer more college prep courses. Schools offering more college prep courses see greater student course-taking, particularly among higher-achieving students. Additionally, taking more prep courses is associated with higher postsecondary credential and bachelor’s degree attainment, especially for lower-achieving students. We recommend that practitioners focus on increasing enrollment in existing college prep coursework, then expand offerings as demand grows.",

        "abstract": "As populations age and informal caregiving becomes more widespread, the health consequences of providing care are becoming a key concern for societies. Sociological theories of stress appraisal and role strain posit detrimental consequences to the health and wellbeing of caregivers. Conversely, role enhancement theory holds that caregiving can have positive health consequences. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) collected among adults aged 50 years or older with a follow-up period of up to 20 years (2002-23, N ca. 20,000 persons), we examine associations between transitions into and out of caregiving, and two key health outcomes which have been understudied as consequences of caregiving, namely: allostatic load and cognitive functioning. We estimate asymmetric fixed-effects models which model changes in health outcomes as a function of transitions into and out of caregiving while accounting for unobserved between-person heterogeneity. Our results show that caregiving is associated with better cognitive health for both men and women, but not with improved biomarker-based allostatic load. Results do not differ by caregiving intensity, irrespective of which amount of time is defined as intense caregiving. Our findings provide support for role enhancement theory, suggesting that caregivers benefit in terms of cognitive functioning, even if a biomarker-based approach to measuring stress-related health outcome does not corroborate an overall health benefit. We formulate implications for policy-making and directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "We know that maternal education benefits child health and well-being. In contexts where extended kin are important sources of social support, there may be additional benefits for children from increased education of their kin. We test the hypothesis that children benefit from having more educated kin using data from an innovative longitudinal project in two low-income communities in Nairobi, Kenya. Leveraging variation in kin members’ exposure to a national policy to lower the cost of secondary school education to account for selection, we find not only an improvement in education levels of kin but also significant intergenerational benefits for children in their families through improved household food security and faster language acquisition. However, we find no evidence that exposure to educated kin improves the nutritional status of these children. The implications of our findings are profound, as they demonstrate the contemporaneous benefits of educational expansion as well as the longer-term effects on subsequent generations, prompting us to rethink the role of education in shaping the well-being of children in low-income communities.",

We document new facts about the absolute and relative mobility in lifespan. On average across cohorts, 47% of men and 57 percent of women lived longer than their parents, though this varied across cohorts. Relative measures show higher mobility, with substantially less variation across time and subpopulations. The intergenerational correlation in lifespan (a measure of persistence rather than mobility) is about 0.09 for both sexes – this low correlation is observed across races, education groups, cohorts, and birth states. Finally, we document that the intergenerational persistence of lifespan is much smaller than the persistence in socio-economic status. Moreover, correlations in lifespan and in education are largely independent of each other, suggesting that mobility in well-being may be larger than measures of income alone suggest.",

        "abstract": "Countries with stronger support to gender equality tend to invest in policies supporting the dual-earner family model or the earner/carer family model, while countries with stronger support to conservative gender norms tend to have policies supporting the male breadwinner family model. However, gender equality norms can be endorsed by the majority of the population at the national level, whilst conservative norms could still be largely supported at the sub-national level, potentially leading to lower uptake of parental leave among fathers in more conservative areas. This study seeks to examine shifting norms in fathers’ parental leave uptake in Finnish municipalities in the 2010s, around the first reform that gave fathers an independent right to a 6-week quota of “solo” parental leave. We applied a Bayesian spatio-temporal model on administrative data from Finnish municipalities and estimated local norms based on voting data and content analysis of political manifestos. Furthermore, we used the proportion of Swedish residents as a proxy for cross-border policy influences from the neighbouring country Sweden, where paternal leave-taking has been a longer phenomenon. Local support to de-familialising policies was found to predict higher leavetaking, but only before the 2013 reform when fathers’ quota use shortened mothers’ leave. The proportion of Swedish-speaking residents was found to be increasingly important for predicting paternal leave-taking. We interpret this result as a sign of cross-border influences from Sweden. Interestingly, uptake increased the fastest in the most conservative region, probably due to its strong linguistic and cultural links to Sweden. Furthermore, we observed spatial dependencies between neighbouring municipalities, which supports our spillover hypothesis; that the interactions among families nearby lead them to adopt new practices. These results trigger new theoretical considerations concerning the role of gender norms in affecting citizens’ behaviour in the family policy field and how these norms interact with policy reforms, the role of national institutions in affecting welfare state preferences at the local level, and the importance of community socialisation.",

        "abstract": "A quarter of a century has passed since the late Terry Crowley summed up the academic consensus that the creole language Bislama poses no immediate threat to any of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. Does this remain true today? Since that time, evidence both quantitative and qualitative has been accumulating that suggests Bislama is indeed gaining ground at the expense of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. In a targeted review of this evidence, this article brings together and assesses the insights of linguists, ethnographers, and others on the causal mechanisms that explain an ongoing shift towards Bislama. It thereby provides both a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and a provisional causal framework for understanding current threats, predicting future threats and, potentially, intervening to prevent future threats. Language endangerment and extinction is a global issue with devastating implications for communities worldwide – one which Vanuatu, the world’s most linguistically diverse country, has thus far remained resilient in the face of. However, this review of the available evidence warns that Bislama will continue to disrupt intergenerational transmission of Indigenous languages unless a suite of inter-related mechanisms can be counteracted.",

        "abstract": "Social stratification is interested in unequal life chances and assumes the existence of a hierarchy of more or less advantageous occupations. Yet occupations are not easily translated into a linear hierarchical measure. Influential scales combine multiple indicators and lack intuitive interpretation. We present a new scale based on occupations’ earnings potential (OEP). The OEP scale measures the median earnings of occupations and expresses them as percentiles of the overall earnings structure: If machine mechanics earn the national median wage, their OEP is 50. We construct national OEP scales using annual microdata pooled over several decades for Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and US. Consistent with the Treiman constant, these national scales are highly correlated over time (r=0.90) and across countries (r=0.80), justifying the use of one common OEP scale. When applied to another European database, the common OEP scale explains a quarter of the variance in earnings – and performs as well for countries used to construct the scale as for countries not used. Moreover, it is associated with the causes (education) and consequences (social mobility) that theory expects it to be. OEP provides a simple, clear and parsimonious indicator of economic advantage that can be meaningfully interpreted.",

        "abstract": "The severe armed conflict in Ethiopia since November 2020 – the start of an armed insurrection by a party (TPLF) in northern Ethiopia - has been framed and impacted upon by digital offensives and global media reporting in peculiar ways. Representations of the conflict events, actors and victims have had a divisive effect on political debate and cooperation in Ethiopia, thus fuelling communal divisions and preventing compromise. The arena of shared politics in federal Ethiopia was further fragmented, with a notable role played by influential global news media and the ‘social’ media. Their politic rhetoric went beyond strategies of persuasion into forms of partisan intimidation, misinformation, bias and even fiction. As with all early 21th-century armed conflicts (cf. the Middle East, Myanmar, or Ukraine), the digital sphere and media manipulation on Ethiopia are shown to be essential domains of discursive battle, extending real life battles, and impacting on international diplomatic responses. The paper analyses some key aspects of the evolving conflict from the perspective of repeated digital ‘memes’ – ‘famine’, ‘genocide’, ‘blockade’, ethnic cleansing’ - and narrative frames – ‘underdog’, ‘self-defense’, ‘peaceful resolution’, ‘truce’ - produced by adherents of one or the other party in the conflict. This contemporary (digital) political rhetoric subverts itself and creates a world of semi-fictitious appearances that perpetuate conflict. The problem of addressing ‘Sophist’ arguments is the same as in Plato’s time (cf. Gorgias), but current digital media allow political rhetoric to massively go beyond the conventions of shared discourse. Using examples, I argue that, beyond the analysis of the digital and news media products themselves, new ways have to be found to ‘reality-check’ or reduce these products/representations to themes amenable for public discussion and eventual shared compromise (cf. Norris 2017: 630). This might help (re)building political rhetoric in a constructive, and not exclusively polemic, manner.",

        "abstract": "We propose a theoretical framework to explain fertility declines over the past two centuries around the world. The framework suggests that low-fertility countries already entered and will persist in a fertility equilibrium in the foreseeable future. What distinguishes our theoretical framework from the previous ones is the centrality of women in our model. The woman has a different interest in fertility decisions from others including her male partner. In most human history, her input in fertility decisions was minimal. As the premodern regime begins to crumble, women gradually become aware of other life choices and obtain reproductive autonomy. These changes inevitably lead to falls in fertility. The falls are ultimately driven by the push for broad gender equality and would continue and not be permanently reversed until they meet pronatalistic forces in a below-replacement environment where the antinatalistic and pronatalistic forces balance out into a fertility equilibrium.",

        "abstract": "This paper compares processes of labour market entry and early career stages in Britain and West Germany. It starts by looking at the characteristics of the respective institutional structures in which human capital is formed and allocated. The two national systems of formal institutions can be regarded as generating particular modes of co-ordination between education and the labour market, that is that the labour market integration of young people follows different rules in the two countries. A frame of reference is provided by a general model that distinguishes between a horizontal, a vertical and a temporal dimension of the process of integration into the labour market. These dimensions are further pursued in empirical terms: here, major aims of the paper are to assess the effects of formal qualifications on the quality of first jobs and to analyse the multi-dimensional stability of entry positions in early careers.

        "abstract": "The impact of scientific research beyond academia is receiving increasing attention from both scientists and the broader community. However, the mechanisms driving this impact remain unclear. This study systematically reviews existing theoretical models and seeks empirical evidence from the REF impact case data. Through grounded coding analysis of 200 cases across four units of assessment, six stages of research generating impact were identified – problem identification, research conduct, output production, output utilization, impact formation, and multi-stakeholder interaction. These stages encompass 10 key elements and 43 corresponding sub-categories, forming a novel theoretical model. Comparative analysis revealed that, while the generation of research impact beyond academia generally follows a similar logic across disciplines, obvious differences exist in motivation, research approach, forms of outputs, types of impacts, etc. This study further provides four typical cases for illustration. Our aim is to enhance the understanding of impact generation processes, promote the societal benefits of scientific research, and provide a basis for research managers to assess scientific contributions according to their distinct characteristics.",

        "abstract": "The average lifespan has increased strongly in the past decades, but not everyone has benefited equally. Establishing the degree of intergenerational persistence of survival generates insights into broad inequalities between individuals and families in their likelihood to live to high ages. Using established register-type data for a region in Southern Sweden 1880-2015, we show that even before the rise of the modern social gradient in health in the 1960ies, mortality is lower among descendants from long-lived parents (top survivors of their birth cohort). This shared survival advantage between parents and children persists over time even after considering SES. Mortality among the descendants of top survivors is lower in lifestyle-related causes of death, suggesting that behavioral factors could be a significant factor in explaining the survival advantage, but also. Overall, we find that mortality concentrates in families in patterns that go beyond the influence of SES alone. Similarities between relatives in health and mortality therefore provide an important lens into inequalities in survival and health over time.",

Um die Möglichkeiten und Grenzen eines solchen Vorhabens seriös ab-zuschätzen, geht es einerseits darum, die derzeitige Leistungsfähigkeit solcher Modelle auszuloten und andererseits das Ziel einer qualitativen Methodenausbil-dung zu bestimmen, denn nur dann lässt sich abschätzen, an welchen Stellen der Ausbildung der Einsatz generativer Sprachmodelle sinnvoll ist. Daher werden wir uns in diesem Beitrag auch mit den Voraussetzungen für die universitäre Lehre qualitativer Methoden der Sozialforschung auseinandersetzen. Wir beschreiben zunächst knapp die herkömmliche Methodenausbildung an-spruchsvoller qualitativer Methoden im Rahmen von Forschungswerkstätten (1). Anschließend stellen wir die neuen Möglichkeiten des Interpretierens zusammen mit generativen Sprachmodellen vor und legen hierbei einen Schwerpunkt auf unser Konzept des Reconstructive Social Research Promptings (RSRP) (Lieder &amp; Schäffer, 2024) (2). Danach geben wir einen komprimierten Einblick in unser Konzept des Interpretierens zusammen mit generativen Sprachmodellen (Schäffer &amp; Lieder, 2023), das mittlerweile auch einen Vorschlag für das konkrete Vorge-hen beinhaltet.

Interactions with biodiversity can benefit human wellbeing, leading to avoided healthcare costs. However, existing research does not account for the species within ecological communities and their effect traits that elicit wellbeing (e.g. colours, sounds). Many species’ effect traits are seasonal, and spatial variation in exposure to ecosystems by different sectors of society can lead to unequal opportunities to gain wellbeing. Here, we use a novel analytical approach to explore how the relationship between forest biodiversity and wellbeing fluctuates: (1) temporally, between different seasons, and (2) spatially, across the socioeconomic deprivation continuum of a human population at a national scale (England and Wales). Forest species’ effect trait richness is spatially heterogeneous, particularly in autumn, spring, and summer. Broadleaf forests have greater species’ effect trait richness than other categories of forest. Forests with higher species’ effect trait richness, and forests that resulted in higher self-reported participant wellbeing, were in areas with the least socioeconomic deprivation. Forest creation/restoration and nature-health interventions must recognise this ecological and social diversity to ensure initiatives are equitable and socially just. Conserving biodiversity will therefore better deliver ecosystems that underpin healthier individuals and societies.",

Each answers a different question: The traditional approach is concerned with understanding the intent and meaning of artifactual marks, while the extended approach focuses on how material forms contribute to numerical realization, explication, and elaboration.

        "abstract": "Importance: While high levels of annual vaccination remains a key strategy for preventing the spread of new COVID-19 variants, most eligible Americans chose not to receive an updated vaccine in 2023. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of two new COVID-19 vaccine uptake communication strategies on annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among vaccine hesitant sub-populations in a high vaccination state, and determine whether or not the messages “scale up” into an effective national messaging strategy. Design: We administered four randomized controlled trials embedded in two large and representative public opinion surveys before and following the availability of updated COVID-19 vaccines. Trials 1 and 2 were conducted in June 2023, and randomly exposed a representative cross-section of adults in a highly vaccinated state (Rhode Island; Trial 1, N = 800) and a nationally representative cross-section US adults (Trial 2, N = 1,000) with messages that normalize the risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group). Trials 3 and 4 were conducted in October 2023, and randomly exposed analogous state (Trial 3, N = 800) and nationally representative survey respondents (Trial 4, N = 1,200) to messages that “de-normalize” constantly-mutating viral threats posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group). Setting: Survey respondents were administered the trials online. Participants: All adults aged 18 or over, residing in either the US (Trials 1, 3) or Rhode Island (specifically; Trials 2, 4), and who were members of a large, online, opt-in survey panel recruitment pool maintained by YouGov, were eligible for inclusion in this study. Interventions: Respondents were randomly assigned to read a short message promoting annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake (vs. a control group, shown an unrelated message). In Trials 1 and 2, messages either made an effort to (a) normalize COVID-19 as endemic (“normalization” [NORM]), (b) both normalize and highlight the Long COVID health risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (“normalization + risk” [NR]), or (c) a control message unrelated to vaccination. In Trials 3 and 4, respondents were randomly assigned to either read (a) the aforementioned “NORM” message, (b) a message “de-normalizing” (DENORM) COVID-19 as a constantly mutating viral risk, or (c) a study-wide control message. Outcomes &amp; Measures: The primary outcome variable in this study measures respondents’ self-reported intentions to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine. The primary explanatory variable in our analyses is an indicator of experimental condition assignment, stratified by whether respondents (a) received a full COVID-19 vaccine sequence &amp; at least one booster shot, (b) received some form of COVID-19 vaccination, but no boosters, or (c) are unvaccinated against COVID-19. Results: In Trials 1 and 2, we find that unvaccinated Rhode Islanders exposed to the NR messaging, but not NORM messaging, were significantly more likely to intend to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine (NORM: B = 0.13, CI = -0.03, 0.30, p = 0.11; NR: B = 0.22, CI = 0.00, 0.44, p = 0.05). In Trials 3 and 4, we find that exposure to DENORM messaging, but not NORM messaging, is also associated with annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among unvaccinated Rhode Islanders (NORM: B = 0.19, CI = -0.03, 0.41, p = 0.10; DENORM: B = 0.23, CI = 0.01, 0.44, p = 0.04). We detect no significant effects in either of our national samples, which post hoc analyses suggest might result from observed and unobserved differences in unvaccinated populations across Rhode Island and national samples. Conclusions: Our work suggests that messaging emphasizing both the endemic health risks (“NR”) and challenges of combating new COVID-19 variants (“DENORM”) may be effective at increasing annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake in unvaccinated populations, and suggest opportunities for future research regarding how differences in state public health contexts might moderate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine communication.",

The lack of definition and any grounding in cognitive theory makes identifying prehistoric symbols and symboling more art than science. A multiplicity of claims from the literature highlight the tendency to claim almost any form from any period of prehistory as symbolic. After the problem is defined, an alternative approach is proposed. The alternative suggests grounding symbols and symboling in contemporary cognitive theory; this would permit the construct to be operationalized as qualities potentially discernable in prehistoric material forms. A multi-level construct is also proposed, one that is not only capable of differentiating symbolic cognition as exhibited by the human species today from the presumably non-symbolic cognition of contemporary non-human primates but which is also able to differentiate both from the emergent symboling capacities of ancestral hominins.",

        "abstract": "Infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is associated with tens of thousands of hospitalizations in a typical year. Most US adults are not likely to experience severe cases of RSV infection, but adults aged 60 or older are at elevated risk of experiencing hospitalization or death due to RSV. While RSV vaccines are available for adults aged 60 or older, and have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood that older adults experience severe cases of RSV, less than one quarter of those eligible have opted to receive the vaccine. In the context of RSV vaccination, Reversal Narrative (RN) messages share stories about individuals who previously refused to receive the vaccine, but – in response to personal negative health outcomes (“regret” RN messaging) and/or new scientific information (“rationalizing” RN messaging) – ultimately changed their mind. In a large and nationally representative survey (N = 1,300) of US adults, as well as a state-representative survey (N = 850) of a highly vaccinated US state, we demonstrate that unvaccinated adults over the age of 60 are significantly more likely to intend to receive an RSV vaccine when exposed to regret-focused (but not rationalizing) RN messaging. We conclude by discussing the viability of RN messaging as a vaccine promotion tactic, and consider how researchers might partner with health communicators to explore their viability in a wide range of health contexts.",

Our findings reveal the following: i) substantial ethnic disparities among drug offenders, but mostly non-existent across other offence categories; ii) area deprivation does not explain away ethnic disparities, but pronounced area disparities are found for breach and assault offences, wherein offenders living in deprived areas are penalised compared to their more affluent counterparts; and iii) ethnicity and area deprivation interact, but only for breach offences, with ethnic minority offenders being treated more harshly than white offenders when residing in deprived areas but favoured when they live in affluent areas.",
