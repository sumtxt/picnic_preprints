        "abstract": "Trust in civil servants is essential for effective governance, enabling policy implementation, public service delivery, and compliance. However, the lack of comparable cross-national data on trust in bureaucracy has limited our ability to systematically examine these relationships. To address this gap, we develop the Trust in Civil Servants (TCS) dataset using an advanced latent-variable modeling technique, using 132 national and cross-national surveys from 98 countries (1986-2022). Our measures reveal variations in trust both within and between countries. We find that economic performance and public security enhance trust in the short term, whereas government quality and effectiveness have more enduring, long-term impacts on trust in civil service. The TCS dataset opens new avenues for examining connections between trust, governance quality, and complex policy challenges across different contexts.",

        "abstract": "The world is currently facing a major challenge: is there a terminal model or universal model that all countries can follow generally? Solving this difficult problem requires finding new problem-solving tools, and the Evolution Period Theory(EPT) proposed by the two authors is such an exploration. The Evolutionary Period Theory is a theory that reveals the evolution process of human economy, or two types of dissipation processes (i.e. the self dissipation and the mutual dissipation), based on improving of the theory of dissipative structure by the authors.Both of these processes need to be periodically promoted within the controliing by institutions and openness.At present, the most developed countries in the world have gone through four periods of agriculture, industry, service, and cultural, and are about to enter the network period. In this process of progress, institutions and openness themselves also undergo periodically changes. Therefore, there is no such thing as a universal model, only a universal period. As an application, this article compares and analyzes the Washington Consensus and the Beijing Consensus, reveals their common problem of attaching important that “development is the key principle“, and proposing a new approach that“ progress is the key principle” .",

        "title": "From Opposition to Opportunity: Enhancing the Acceptance of Carbon Taxes Through Effective Policy Design",
        "authors": "Hamid Bulut, Robin\tSamuel",
        "created": "2024-12-30",
        "abstract": "An increasing number of countries are considering implementing domestic carbon taxes to achieve the carbon-reduction targets set in the Paris Agreement. However, introducing such taxes presents significant challenges for policymakers worldwide. Despite their effectiveness, carbon taxes remain the least popular policy instrument. Furthermore, few studies focus on public support for carbon taxation in low- and middle-income countries, a crucial area of research given the global significance of their emissions. Therefore, we conducted a pre-registered full factorial survey experiment involving more than 13,000 evaluations of policy designs in China, Germany, India, and the UK to address the most prevalent barriers to the popularity of carbon taxes, as discussed in academic research, policy analysis, and public discourse: perceived effectiveness, average household costs, the types of revenue recycling schemes implemented, and the extent of international cooperation. Our findings revealed striking differences in how the countries responded to carbon tax policies. The key findings included the following: cost transparency unexpectedly reduced support, whereas communicating the effectiveness of the policy increased it; preferences for revenue recycling schemes varied significantly across the four countries, highlighting the need for tailored approaches; and, surprisingly, international cooperation increased support only in Germany, challenging assumptions about global climate policy. These findings have profound implications for policymakers, suggesting that an effective carbon tax design must be carefully calibrated in the national context. This study provides a roadmap for designing carbon tax policies that are environmentally effective and politically viable for diverse global economies.",

        "abstract": "This article focuses on the propensity to patent across Italian regions, considering data from ISTAT-BES between 2004 and 2019 to contribute to analyzing regional gaps and determinants of innovative performances. Results show how the North-South gap in innovative performance has persisted over time, confirming the relevance of research intensity, digital infrastructure, and cultural employment on patenting activity. These relations have been analyzed using the panel data econometric model. It allows singling out crucial positive drivers like R&amp;D investment or strongly negative factors, such as limited mobility of graduates. More precisely, given the novelty of approaches applied in the used model, the following contributions are represented: first, the fine grain of regional differentiation, from which the sub-national innovation system will be observed. It also puts forward a set of actionable policy recommendations that would contribute to more substantial inclusive innovation, particularly emphasizing less-performing regions. By focusing on such dynamics, this study will indirectly address how regional characteristics and policies shape innovation and technological competitiveness in Italy. Therefore, it contributes to the debate on regional systems of innovation and their possible role in economic development in Europe since the economic, institutional, and technological conditions are differentiated between various areas in Italy.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is a developing country with a population of over 160 million people and a GDP of $437.42 billion USD (2023). The country is reeling from inflation that is forecast to be about 9-10% this year. The increase stems mainly from global disruptions, dependence on imports and a weakening currency. Although the government has endeavored to contain inflation with more restrictive monetary policies and subsidies, these are not inclusive due to budget constraints and slow growth of the economy. Structural reforms are also required to promote local production as opposed to relying on imports. If global circumstances improve, inflation may fall back to something similar to 5-6%. A well-coordinated strategy is key to managing inflation, fostering growth, and ensuring long-term stability.",

        "abstract": "The vulnerable status of young people and their inadequate integration during entry into the labor market has been shown to increase the risk of several unfavorable outcomes in adulthood. In this study, we provide a longitudinal perspective to the labor market integration of young people by analyzing the dynamics of being a young Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET). We focus on entry to and persistence of the NEET situation across time, namely genuine state dependence, by using correlated dynamic random-effects logit models to study the effect of the past on the current NEET situation. We analyze longitudinal individual-level data covering the full population living in Finland with a follow-up from age 18 till age 29 from 1995 till 2020. Our findings suggest clear state dependence in the NEET situation: being NEET in the previous year is associated with almost a 3-percentage-point increase in the probability of being NEET in the current year. We find that the state dependence of the NEET situation is moderately elevated for males and for those with lower parental educational attainment and considerably elevated for those with foreign origin or history of mental health issues or with child protection services.",

        "abstract": "Language technologies, especially those related to AI and machine learning, have grown increasingly popular as objects and methods of study for sociologists. We contend that to understand these objects and their place in our social world, we must attend to a linguistic sociology. In the context of large language models, for example, language -text, specifically- acts as both the input and output interface between person and machine. Yet text is itself a language technology, and carries with it affordances and constraints that remember long histories of social relations. Quilting together literature from sociology, computational linguistics, science and technology studies, and linguistic anthropology, we ask: what do language technologies remember, and how can sociologists take these memories into account? To answer this question, we offer a three-part analytical framework to examine how the memories of language technologies are both constructed by and constructing our social world. Drawing on two examples of use of language technologies in college admissions and in scientific peer review, we apply our framework to demonstrate how language technologies can mediate social actions, processes, and relations.",

        "abstract": "The 1980s and 1990s were a period of improving life expectancy in the population of Great Britain, combined with a sharp increase in the proportion of men who were economically inactive due to ill-health. In order to address this apparent contradiction, this paper examines a series of health measures in two independent, stratified random samples of men aged 20-59, taken from cross-sectional population surveys of England in 1984 and 2001. It compares, in each year, levels of health according to these measures amongst the employed with those in the unemployed and permanently sick. It finds that for many conditions there was a particularly large improvement among men who were economically inactive and unemployed, greater than that in the employed. By 2001, health in unemployed men in several respects was superior to that of the employed. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance to understanding some paradoxes in the British labour market in the early 1980s, such as the relationship between unemployment and wage inflation.",

        "authors": "Michael Jacob",
        "created": "2024-12-30",
        "abstract": "What enables humanity to flourish? Surely, it is more than our biological survival as individuals, or even as a species. As a modern science, biology does not typically address the social, ethical and religious dimensions of human flourishing. Here I propose a transdisciplinary scientific framework for flourishing, rooted in evolvability: the capacity to increase the probability of an evolutionary outcome. I define human energy as a fuel for our evolvability as a species, reflecting a natural extension of biological processes that utilize dynamically structured, latent energy to anticipate the future. These processes of creative energy leverage serendipitous interactions within biochemical, neural, and social networks to constellate innovative pathways. As a result of this creative energy, organisms are more than literally “alive” (surviving) but are “meta-alive,” (flourishing and evolvable). Nonetheless, purely biological descriptions and investigations are insufficient to describe, let alone explain flourishing at the level of humanity. Humans imagine the future. We are nourished not only from metabolism, but through the energy of the arts, literature, and religion (the humanities). Mirroring prior major evolutionary transitions, human energy enables transcendence: moving from the biology of the individual to novel forms at a collective level. Human energy manifests this through imagination, compassion and what the poet Keats’ called, negative capability, a radical stance of not-knowing. Making sense of these energetic transitions requires a new metascience, a transdisciplinary bridge between the biological sciences and the humanities.",

        "created": "2024-12-23",
        "abstract": "This research explores the enduring global health challenges posed by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and its progression to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). It provides an in-depth review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, prevention strategies, psychosocial impacts, health policies, and persistent barriers associated with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The study examines global prevalence and incidence patterns, with a focus on the disproportionate impact in sub-Saharan Africa and key demographics such as men who have sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDUs), and marginalized youth. It highlights gender and age-specific prevalence disparities and discusses how these intersect with socio-behavioral determinants of health. Mechanisms of HIV infection are analyzed, detailing how the virus depletes CD4 T-cells, leading to immune system compromise. Modes of transmission, including sexual contact, vertical transmission, and blood exposure, are evaluated alongside risk-enhancing factors such as substance use and insufficient awareness. Advances in treatment are a key focus, with antiretroviral therapy (ART) highlighted as the cornerstone of HIV management. The potential of emerging therapies, such as long-acting injectables and gene-editing technologies, is discussed in the context of achieving functional cures. Challenges to treatment adherence and access are critically examined. Prevention strategies are explored through a dual lens: behavioral interventions like condom use and sexual health education, and biomedical measures including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Structural interventions and policy initiatives addressing social determinants of health are assessed, emphasizing the role of community-based programs in reducing transmission and improving outcomes. The psychosocial dimensions of HIV/AIDS are analyzed, with particular attention to stigma, discrimination, and their impacts on mental health and treatment compliance. The importance of support networks and community engagement in fostering resilience and adherence is underscored. Finally, the paper evaluates national and international policy responses, detailing the contributions of organizations such as WHO and UNAIDS. Persistent challenges, including healthcare disparities, drug resistance, and gaps in research, are addressed, alongside calls for culturally sensitive, equitable care approaches and sustained funding. This research synthesizes current knowledge, identifies critical gaps, and outlines future directions to enhance prevention, treatment, and policy frameworks, ultimately aiming to improve outcomes for individuals and communities affected by HIV/AIDS.",

        "abstract": "While travelers may have the same origin and destination for their trips, these trips may be associated with different travel times. Understanding what factors contribute to different travel times contributes to better transportation planning and driver experience improvement. Big mobile device data offers new opportunities to understand travelers’ driving behaviors by providing high-resolution trip trajectory data. In this study we analyzed factors including driver behaviors, built environment and road characteristics, and external factors (e.g., traffic incidents and weather), for their contributions to travel times for two different travel contexts, commuting in an urban environment and rural trips involving a vacation destination, using machine learning approaches including time-series clustering and Random Forest regression models. We found that specific driver route choices (i.e., the different routes that drivers followed including the use of highways or local roads), and individualized travel speed behaviors including speeding contributed to variations in travel times. Vehicle profiles (i.e., types of vehicle drivers used) and road incidents had different impacts for different trip contexts. These results are useful for urban and transportation planners seeking mitigations that reduce travel time along heavily traveled driving routes and contribute to determining more accurate travel time predictions.",

        "authors": "Gail Davies",
        "created": "2024-12-26",
        "abstract": "Many medical appointments involve encounters with patients who report physical symptoms, including experiences of pain or altered sensations (paraesthesia), where health professionals cannot generate an explanation based on scans, blood tests, or other currently privileged forms of medical evidence. In these cases, the personal interruptions of illness are not easily resolved through the narrative of investigation followed by treatment. Other things are created in this absence, including patient anxiety and medical uncertainty, even patient isolation and health professional avoidance, which exacerbate the impact of symptoms. This paper recounts my own experience of receiving a negative scan for cauda equina syndrome and my subsequent search for a meaningful account of what was happening to my body. I use autoethnography to illustrate how these ‘medically unexplained’ symptoms were reinterpreted by health professionals and myself through different forms of encounter, evidence, and explanation, in ways that shifted interpretations and bodily sensations, but offered limited ideas for recovery. The account is personal, in the details of navigating the UK health services with ‘medically unexplained’ symptoms during an ongoing pandemic, and the way I found conversations around functional neurological symptoms helpful for making sense of corporeal experience. Concluding, I reflect on the importance of listening responsively to patient stories in the case of ‘medically unexplained’ or functional symptoms. Generating the possibility for patient participation in the co-production of health and care in this area is challenging but critically important given the close intersection between medical expectations, cultural assumptions, and patient experiences of ‘medically unexplained’ symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Purpose In August 2022, the Association of Social Work Boards released a long called for pass rate analysis that revealed significant disparities. While many states look to cease the requirement of the Bachelors, Masters, and Advanced Generalist exams in their licensure process, status quo bias leads to hesitancy to remove the requirement of the Clinical exam. Method A critical review was undertaken to identify possible alternatives to the current multiple-choice competency-based exam which yielded three assessment formats (oral exams, portfolios, and performance assessment/simulations) and two alternatives (jurisprudence exams and provisional licensure). Informed by an Afrocentric lens, we undertook a social and racial policy analysis to examine alternative pathways for licensure from the perspective of a social work board member. We centered our analysis on the impacts on (1) Black social workers, who currently have the highest pass-rate disparities; (2) social workers whose primary language is not English, and (3) social workers with disabilities who have anecdotally reported difficulty with getting testing accommodations. We rated each alternative on four social equity analysis criteria of procedural fairness, access, quality, and outcomes. These ratings were computed into an overall rating for each alternative from equitable to inequitable. Results We found jurisprudence exams and provisional licensure have the best possibility of being equitable pathways to licensure, with potential impacts on the regulation of supervision and continuing education. Conclusion Anti-racism and social justice as praxis require social work as a profession to divest from competency-based testing to eliminate racism in our own professional policies.",
