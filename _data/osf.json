        "title": "The Impact of Vacancy Taxes on Housing Prices: A Synthetic Control Study",

        "abstract": "Importance: Cities in North America are beginning to wield vacancy taxes (a property tax imposed on unoccupied homes) as a tool to reduce rapidly growing home prices. However, these taxes are being implemented with little to no empirical evidence backing their effectiveness. Objective: To determine whether Washington, D.C.’s 2003-imposed vacancy tax impacted home prices. Design: A panel data set for the years 1978-2013 was compiled for this analy- sis. Data was collected on 13 different variables related to the housing market for 31 metropolitan statistical areas, including Washington, D.C. The synthetic control method was applied to create a counterfactual Washington, D.C. using the available variables and donor cities. House price comparisons were then made over time to deter- mine what Washington, D.C.’s average house prices would have been absent their 2003 vacancy tax, as measured by the synthetic control unit. Robustness checks, placebo tests, and time series analyses were subsequently used to validate and investigate the primary results. Results: Contrary to expectations, there is a gap following the 2003 treatment that suggests Washington, D.C.’s tax may have increased house prices rather than decreased or limited them. An interrupted time series analysis also shows a statistically significant break in the house price trajectory starting in approximately 2005. However, a placebo in space test casts doubt on any significant results as Washington, D.C.’s outcomes are unremarkable when applying the potential treatment to other U.S. cities. Conclusions and Relevance: There is no evidence that the 2003 tax reduced house prices. Local governments in North America should be cautious about imple- menting vacancy taxes if the primary or sole purpose is to reduce or restrict house prices.",

        "abstract": "Opposition parties in modern democracies often find themselves having to balance their various functions and goals, such as representing their voters and influencing policy-making on the one hand, and criticising the government and presenting an alternative to it on the other hand. The emphasis on either of these functions leads to different strategies, measurable by confrontation or agreement with the government. Recent studies suggest that voters tend to reward opposition parties for confronting the government. However, these have relied on observational analyses and have not been able to investigate the underlying micro-mechanisms in detail. In this paper, we present the results of a novel survey experiment conducted among 12,824 respondents in nine European countries. The respondents were shown several hypothetical government-opposition interactions regarding government legislation and were asked to rate the opposition’s response. We manipulate the legislation initiative’s subject, direction, and magnitude, as well as the opposition’s response, distinguishing not only between agreement and confrontation but also between ideological and other justifications. Among other findings, we show that voters prefer compromise and agreement over refusal to compromise, but this preference is weaker the farther the proposed legislation is from the opposition’s ideal point.",

        "authors": "Sanne van Oosten",
        "created": "2026-01-12",
        "abstract": "To what extent does sharing the same religion, migration background and gender versus policy positions impact voting? Most evidence comes from the US and majority populations, but European minorities may respond differently. In this study, respondents from France, Germany and the Netherlands choose between profiles of hypothetical politicians with randomised politician religion, migration background, gender and policy positions. Oversampling voters with a migration background (N=1,889/3,058), among which a portion identifies as Muslim (N=649/3,058), reveals that instead of minorities, majorities are just as, if not more, likely to engage in affinity voting. Shared religion is the most influential affinity impacting Muslim and non-religious voters. Sharing the same migration background or gender has no positive impact on voting likelihood; on the contrary, the findings suggest that voters with a migration background tend to prefer politicians without a migration background. Non-religious voters exhibit an in-group preference both when voter and politician agree but especially when voter and politician disagree about policy. These findings reveal the electoral challenges to achieving diversity in politics and minority representation, particularly concerning the political inclusion of Muslims.",

        "authors": "Meri Dankenbring",
        "created": "2026-01-15",
        "abstract": "This article sheds light on dynamics of pacification and how they can be affected by insurgent extremity and violence against civilians. While previous research suggests that (civilian) deaths shape the probability of negotiations, it shows that the effect can take two directions. As increasing death tolls mean higher conflict costs, they can lower the probability of negotiations. At the same time, civilian killings may increase the conflict’s intractability and decrease trust between the parties, thus lowering the probability of negotiations. I argue that the direction of the effect of civilian targeting depends on insurgent ideology. When the insurgents’ extremity is low, they can use civilian targeting to exert power and pressure the government into negotiations. When their extremity is high, civilian targeting is more likely to have the opposite effect: Killing civilians can lower trust in the insurgents and entrench cleavages in society. Apart from this moderated effect via civilian killings, I also expect extremity to have a direct effect on the probability of conflict parties entering into meaningful negotiations. As high extremity increases both commitment and indivisibility problems, insurgents are less likely to meaningfully negotiate with increasing extremity. These expectations are supported by an analysis conducted using data on insurgent ideologies in civil wars between 1990 and 2020.",

        "abstract": "El presente estudio integra el análisis de dos escaladas geopolíticas contemporáneas (Trump-Maduro 2025 y Trump-Petro 2025-2026) desde una perspectiva psicoanalítica freudiana, examinando cómo las dinámicas de narcisismo patológico, agresión y pulsión de muerte se manifiestan en el liderazgo político contemporáneo. Mediante un análisis cualitativo comparativo basado en los conceptos freudianos de narcisismo, agresión como pulsión fundamental, y el conflicto irresoluble entre Eros y Tánatos en la civilización, se exploran las continuidades entre la teoría psicoanalítica clásica y las crisis geopolíticas actuales. Los resultados sugieren que el narcisismo patológico en líderes con acceso a poder militar masivo representa una manifestación contemporánea del \"malestar en la cultura\" freudiano: la civilización tecnológica ha amplificado exponencialmente las capacidades destructivas humanas sin proporcionar mecanismos equivalentes para la regulación de impulsos agresivos narcisistas. El estudio examina cómo la asimetría de poder, la provocación calculada, y la imposibilidad psicológica de retroceso en líderes narcisistas crean dinámicas de escalada que trascienden la racionalidad estratégica. Se discuten las implicaciones de los planteamientos freudianos sobre la guerra, la agresión y las limitaciones de la razón civilizatoria para comprender y potencialmente mitigar crisis contemporáneas donde personalidades patológicas controlan arsenales destructivos. El análisis concluye que la pregunta freudiana \"¿Por qué la guerra?\" permanece vigente en el siglo XXI, requiriendo una integración de comprensión psicoanalítica con salvaguardas institucionales para proteger a la civilización de sus propios líderes.",

        "authors": "Ruslan Guseinov",
        "created": "2026-01-12",
        "abstract": "Why do some autocracies experience violent anti-regime mobilization while others remain quiescent? The literature does not provide sufficient theoretical arguments and empirical evidence linking fiscal strength in autocracies to mass mobilization. In my paper, I suggest that fiscal capacity shapes authoritarian stability: autocracies with greater fiscal room can finance public goods, the military and security apparatus at high levels, solving the fundamental problem of authoritarian control and power-sharing. Moreover, higher fiscal capacity increases protest costs for citizens, which constitutes a \"silence-buying\" effect, a new term I coin in the context of authoritarian civil resistance. My argument stems from some comparative politics theories and theoretical statements of Jack Goldstone and Theda Skocpol. Using panel data on violent mass anti-regime mobilization from 2003 to 2022 and introducing a novel operationalization of fiscal capacity as central government debt, I employ logistic models for protest onset and negative binomial models for protest counts to estimate the effect of the central government debt on violent contention. Across specifications, robustness checks and zero-inflation corrections, the effect stays significantly positive, suggesting that fiscal constraints pose a destabilizing threat to autocracies. Findings show that fiscal capacity has been overlooked as a viable factor of contention and provide sufficient evidence in favor of a new operationalization of fiscal capacity.",

        "authors": "Aishwarya Ravikumar",
        "created": "2026-01-11",
        "abstract": "Governments seeking to raise labour productivity face a persistent policy dilemma between providing direct wage support and subsidising skill development. While wage support can stabilise incomes and boost labour supply in the short term, skill-development subsidies are often promoted as a means of enhancing long-term employability and productivity, though their effectiveness varies widely across contexts. This paper asks: under what institutional and incentive conditions do skill-development subsidies outperform direct wage support in improving long-term labour market outcomes? Using a comparative policy analysis based on secondary data from OECD, World Bank, and ILO evaluations, the paper examines how labour market incentives, employer participation, and institutional capacity shape policy performance. The analysis finds that skill-development subsidies generate superior long-term outcomes when programs are closely aligned with labour market demand, supported by credible employer involvement, and implemented by institutions capable of enforcing targeting and quality standards. In the absence of these conditions, direct wage support often delivers more predictable short- to medium-term results. The paper contributes to the labour economics literature by emphasising the conditional nature of policy effectiveness and by identifying design principles for integrating income support with human capital investment.",

The EPI provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating environmental health, ecosystem vitality and climate change. Greece, as a member of the European Union (EU), operates within a complex regulatory framework aimed at promoting sustainable development. Greece's performance in the EPI reflects both its environmental policy efforts and its exposure to regional challenges such as air pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate-related risks. In recent years, Greece has demonstrated progress in areas such as renewable energy development and climate change mitigation, although issues like waste management and air quality continue to require focused policy intervention. Analyzing Greece’s EPI score offers valuable insights into its environmental priorities and the effectiveness of national strategies aimed at promoting sustainability and resilience.",

        "authors": "Niall Reddy, Virgilio Urbina Lazardi",
        "created": "2026-01-12",
        "abstract": "Recent empirical work (Hickel et al. 2021, 2022) appears to show that the Global South is being ``drained\" of resources and value on a vast scale through unequal exchange (UE) and/or ecologically unequal exchange (EUE). Headline estimates of the aggregate value of this extraction have been widely taken to substantiate two politico-normative issues: that the South is systematically exploited through international price formation, and that this drain constitutes a binding constraint on Southern development and a precondition for Northern prosperity. This paper argues that neither claim is supported by the new measurement agenda. It shows that new drain estimates rely on untenable premises -- in particular, claims of North-South parity in productivity and export composition. Stipped of these assumptions, Hickel et al's method can't yield a counterfactual ``fair price\" vector, meaning that their estimates are ungrounded and indeterminate. Moreover, even granting the estimates, they do not sustain an underdevelopment thesis. In standard growth regressions and long-run club-convergence tests, higher measured drain is non-negative and often positively associated with Southern growth once conventional fundamentals are controlled for. The paper suggests ways that research in ecological economics can be placed on a firmer conceptual footing.",

        "authors": "Vicky Armando Ambate",
        "created": "2026-01-14",
        "abstract": "Research on export performance has extensively examined the roles of export orientation, global networks, and dynamic capabilities in enhancing firms’ export outcomes, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, existing studies largely rely on direct-effect approaches and provide limited explanation of the internal mechanisms through which external resources and organizational capabilities are transformed into export performance. Moreover, the literature tends to treat global mindset, strategic cognition, and export orientation as separate constructs, resulting in fragmented insights and inconsistent empirical findings. Addressing these gaps, this study proposes the development and empirical examination of Global Export Strategic Mindset (GESM) as a conceptually derived construct that functions as a strategic mechanism linking global network and global dynamic capability to export performance. GESM is conceptualized as a cross-level strategic capability that integrates managerial global perspective, strategic cognitive processing, and organizational commitment to exporting. Operationally, GESM is modeled as a higher-order construct comprising three dimensions: Global Strategic Cognition, Strategic Export Commitment, and Global–Local Strategic Integration. This study adopts a quantitative, explanatory research design. Data are planned to be collected through a survey of exporting SMEs in Indonesia and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the proposed structural relationships and the mediating role of GESM. The proposed research is expected to contribute to export performance and internationalization literature by providing a mechanism-based explanation of how global resources and capabilities are converted into effective export strategies, while offering practical insights for strengthening the strategic capacity of SMEs in emerging economies.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new public-access online database containing internationally comparable estimates of inequality of opportunity for seventy-two countries, covering two-thirds of the world’s population. The estimates were computed directly from the unit-record microdata for 196 household surveys, using a suite of machine-learning tools selected to minimize the omitted variable and overfitting biases discussed in the literature. Overall, differences in opportunities account for substantial shares of total income inequality (with the mean of our preferred estimate being 40.9%), but there is substantial variation across countries, with estimates ranging from 18.9% in Denmark (2011) to 76.7% in South Africa (2017). The latest US estimate of 41.6% places it among the most opportunity unequal high-income countries. We also find strong support for the existence of a positive association between income inequality and relative inequality of opportunity, analogous to the “Great Gatsby Curve” for mobility and inequality. Similarly, there is evidence of an inverted-U “Opportunity Kuznets curve.” The database is available at www.geom.ecineq.org. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

        "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",

        "abstract": "Desde a descoberta da penicilina por Alexander Fleming, em 1928, o setor farmacêutico expandiu-se de modo acelerado, tornando-se, na atualidade, um dos segmentos mais poderosos da economia global, com faturamento anual estimado em cerca de US$ 1,5 trilhão e grandes corporações avaliadas em centenas de bilhões de dólares. Embora avanços científico-tecnológicos e transformações socioeconômicas tenham impulsionado a pesquisa e o desenvolvimento de medicamentos, contribuindo para ganhos relevantes, a literatura crítica tem destacado práticas controversas de influência corporativa – aqui sintetizadas como “Influência, Desvios e Excessos” – que favorecem o crescimento, a rentabilidade e a consolidação de poder, por vezes em conflito com o interesse coletivo e a saúde pública. Nesse contexto, este artigo adota delineamento exploratório-descritivo e abordagem mista, com triangulação entre dados públicos, documentos institucionais e revisão crítica da literatura internacional, a fim de mapear e descrever mecanismos de influência corporativa no setor farmacêutico em oito eixos: (i) lobby e financiamento eleitoral; (ii) influência em órgãos de regulação e fiscalização; (iii) influência em organizações de pacientes; (iv) influência na elaboração de diretrizes clínicas; (v) manipulação, promoção e ocultação de pesquisas e testes de medicamentos; (vi) escrita fantasma; (vii) estratégias de ampliação diagnóstica e promoção de doenças; e (viii) financiamento e oferta de benefícios a prescritores e instituições, incluindo mecanismos psicossociais e dimensões formativas. Os achados indicam que a influência corporativa se estrutura em múltiplas escalas e opera de forma simultaneamente visível e difusa. No plano político, evidencia-se a centralidade do lobby e do financiamento eleitoral como instrumentos de conformação do ambiente normativo e regulatório, com expansão progressiva dos investimentos. Na esfera regulatória, a recorrência de conflitos de interesse em comitês consultivos e a circulação de quadros entre agências e empresas sugerem vulnerabilidades à captura institucional, com implicações para os processos de aprovação, fiscalização e retirada de medicamentos. No domínio científico, o patrocínio industrial associa-se a vieses que podem incidir desde o desenho e a condução de ensaios até a publicação seletiva de resultados, além de práticas como ghostwriting e estratégias de “preparação de mercado”, afetando a credibilidade e a circulação das evidências. Em paralelo, observa-se a atuação da indústria na expansão diagnóstica e na medicalização de condições da vida cotidiana, ampliando mercados e podendo invisibilizar determinantes sociais e abordagens não farmacológicas. Na prática clínica, pagamentos e transferências de valor a prescritores e instituições de ensino associam-se a mudanças nos padrões de prescrição, aumento de custos e favorecimento de medicamentos promovidos, inclusive por meio de benefícios de baixo valor, mediados por vieses cognitivos.",

        "abstract": "Attention is notoriously definitionally fragmented, which results in downstream confusion in applied theory. In this paper, I introduce Conserved Attention Theory (CAT), in which attention is defined as the per-actor, per-instant allocation of bounded processing resources, idealized as fully allocated and zero-sum. Allocations leave physical traces (artifacts) in actors and external environments that bias future allocation in a feedback loop. Attention space is an actor’s individually-instantiated associative topology across potential allocation biases, both internal and external. I demonstrate that the convergence of overlapping attention spaces is sufficient for social patterns and behavior to emerge without the requirement of a separate ontological social layer. I show that attention spaces and emergent social consequences remain subject to thermodynamics and entropy. This framework provides a physically grounded approach to reframe social phenomena like social polarization in physical terms rather than as rational or moral failures.",

        "abstract": "In November 2025, a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia unsealed a spreadsheet containing the locations of 614 automatic license plate reader (ALPR) cameras currently in use in Hampton Roads, Virginia. ALPR cameras are an emergent form of networked surveillance infrastructure that capture images of every vehicle that passes by, generate a “vehicle fingerprint,” and store those data in databases searchable by law enforcement, typically without warrants or court orders for access. The release of these locational data provides a rare opportunity to examine the opaque geography of contemporary surveillance and to assess whether ALPR camera deployment reproduces the same racialized and classed patterns long associated with policing and state surveillance in the United States. In this article, we use geographic information systems (GIS) and descriptive statistical analysis to map the distribution of 614 Flock Safety ALPR cameras in relation to racial and poverty profiles of the neighborhoods where the cameras are located. Our findings show that ALPR camera deployment is deeply and systematically racialized and economically stratified, with predominantly Black and high-poverty neighborhoods bearing a disproportionate share of ALPR surveillance infrastructure across Hampton Roads. We argue that these patterns do not reflect isolated siting decisions, but rather are the result of broader structural dynamics, including the privatization of surveillance infrastructure, weak democratic oversight, and the normalization of seemingly objective, tech-washed policing. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for public policy, civil liberties, democratic accountability, and Fourth Amendment protections.",

        "abstract": "In an era in which most organizations are not explicitly built around racist aims and most organizational actors do not admit racial bias, how do racial inequalities nevertheless persist? In recent years, research scholarship fusing race and organizational theories has made an important analytical intervention: Organizations are not merely venues of racial animus and racial inequality but, rather, race is constitutive of organizations. But contra Ray’s (2019) emphasis on attending to “broadly shared racial schemas,” this paper employs Durkheim’s notion of sacred–profane divisions to argue that analysts should focus on the case-specific issue of the binary divisions that define legitimacy within a particular organizational field. It is via hallowed institutional categories that organizations produce, encode, and obscure racial disparities and meanings. To illustrate the potential and flexibility of such an approach, this paper takes up the case of the alternative food sector, drawing on 11 months of ethnographic research at a large farmers market and analysis of four decades of organizational records. Findings reveal how the racial order is reinforced not only through racial animus and racial schemas, but it also unfolds via the most ordinary of this market’s organizational pathways, from membership lists, certifications, and placement in geographical space. Importantly, these racialized dynamics would neither be observed nor explained by prevailing organizational frameworks of racial stratification.",

By shifting our analytical lens from actors to public cultural ideas and object, our theory can explain change in cultural forms over large and long frames of analysis using formal evolutionary mechanisms. Complementing this theory, the paper introduces a suite of novel methods to explain change in the historical trajectories of populations of cultural ideas/objects (e.g., music groups, hashtags, laws, technologies, and organizations) through diversification rates. We deploy our theory and methods to study the history of Metal Music over more than three decades, using a complete dataset of all bands active between 1968 and 2000. Over the course of its history, we find strong evidence that the genre has been fundamentally shaped by competition between ideas for the cognitive resources actors can invest in learning about and reproducing this cultural form over time.

        "abstract": "Indonesia and many other nations present a paradox: high levels of religiosity coexist with systematic patterns of fraud and financial exploitation targeting religious communities. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain mechanisms of trust exploitation in religious-collectivist communities, with empirical focus on documented fraud cases in Indonesia and the Southeast Asian region. Drawing on synthesis of literature regarding particularized versus generalized trust in social psychology, affinity fraud documentation in fraud prevention research, victimization theory, and empirical case studies, this paper identifies three interacting mechanisms. First, trust calibration mismatch reveals how lived experience in high-trust environments develops trust heuristics optimal for in-group contexts but vulnerable when out-group actors adopt in-group signals. Second, religious rationalization encompasses assumptions about religious deterrence and delegation of justice to God, reducing urgency for verification or formal reporting. Third, temporal familiarity exploitation demonstrates how perpetrators systematically build long-term relationships before large financial extraction. These three mechanisms generate an opportunity structure aligned with Fraud Triangle theory, where detection probability and punishment probability remain low while payoffs are substantial. This paper maintains a critical distinction between religious teachings (which explicitly prohibit deception) and religious identity as social signal (which can be exploited). The vulnerability analyzed is contextual rather than inherent to religiosity itself, emerging from specific configuration of high collectivism, religiosity as dominant identity marker, weak formal institutions, and strong social harmony norms. The framework is exploratory, grounded in existing literature and documented cases, and invites future empirical validation while offering implications for financial literacy education, fraud prevention policy, and institutional strengthening in religious communities.",

Drawing on Boike Rehbein’s concept of kaleidoscopic dialectics and sociological theory of collective learning, we argue that dominant sustainability governance frameworks —centered on innovation and predictive forecasting— reinforce existing narrative orders and institutional path dependencies, thereby constraining imagination and systemic change. Backcasting, by contrast, begins with desirable futures and works backward to identify present actions, enabling inclusive deliberation across diverse epistemic, cultural, and political perspectives. We show how this approach can operationalize radical sociological imagination, challenge expert monopolies on rationality, and reduce inequalities in participation, knowledge production, and global governance. By integrating normative reflection with pluralistic scenario-building, backcasting creates conditions for discursive democracy and cultural cross-fertilization, offering a pragmatic tool to reconfigure socio-cognitive matrices and institutional arrangements in the face of civilizational crisis.",

        "abstract": "First documented in 1930, the Black–White mortality crossover remains one of the most enduring puzzles in Demography. Black Americans experience higher age-specific mortality rates than White Americans throughout most of the life course, yet this pattern reverses at advanced ages. A leading explanation is that there is no crossover at all. Rather, differential age misreporting or other data errors create a spurious crossover. We use a large-scale administrative cohort dataset of American men (N = 2.3 million deaths) to assess whether the Black–White mortality crossover is real or an artifact of data error. We find a mortality crossover for the male birth cohorts of 1890–1905 at age 86. At age 75, Black men have nearly a 10% higher probability of dying than White men, but by age 95, the probability of dying is 8% higher for White men. The quality of our mortality data, paired with a series of sensitivity analyses, provides new evidence that the observed crossover is not an artifact of age misreporting. Our findings address a long-standing empirical debate and emphasize the need for further investigation into alternative explanations of the crossover, including selective survival mechanisms and reversals of group-specific disadvantage at advanced ages.",

Para ayudar a reducir esta brecha, este estudio cuantitativo analiza los factores que influyen en la confianza en los medios, centrándose en diferencias por edad y género. Mediante una encuesta en línea (n=2,005) y pruebas no paramétricas de Mann-Whitney y Kruskal-Wallis, se hallaron diferencias significativas por edad en siete de ocho factores analizados. Los grupos de mayor edad, especialmente aquellos entre 50 y 64 años, valoran más la trayectoria histórica de los medios, sus estándares periodísticos, la transparencia informativa y la alineación con sus valores personales al momento de decidir en qué medios confiar. En contraste, el género no fue una variable determinante, excepto en la valoración de la trayectoria histórica, donde las mujeres tienden a darle más importancia que los hombres.

        "abstract": "As renewables become the dominant source of electricity, insufficient adaptations of overall system designs to the demands of renewables produce costs and uncertainties. Sustainability transitions research has failed so far to foreground these issues due to its focus on early transition challenges and a theoretical emphasis on market diffusion, technology support, and mechanisms of weak coordination. In this paper, we argue that challenges and thus potential solutions in advanced transition phases differ fundamentally from those in early transition stages. Demands for strong forms of coordination between system elements and across institutional spheres increase. However, such systems planning raises distinct capacity and legitimacy demands. The availability of robust institutions for systems planning is therefore a key, hitherto neglected success factor for advanced energy transitions. To develop this argument empirically, we draw on an in-depth qualitative case study of the German energy transition as a paradigmatic case in which successful renewable expansion has led to a growing mismatch between legacy system features and transition affordances. Attempts to address this mismatch through enhanced, whole-of-system coordination oriented towards Germany’s net zero goal have been met with institutional barriers that increase the power of opponents. We argue that such problems are emblematic for advanced transitions.",

Individuals are characterized by multiple attributes interacting in complex ways, challenging the unidimensional view on homophilic relationship formation. We introduce a multidimensional social distance attachment model integrating both exclusive (e.g., gender) and non-exclusive (e.g., language) features to capture homo- and hetero-philic behaviors. By embedding attributes as vectors within a metric space, we estimate the relative contribution of each attribute to the overall network features, and evaluate how their correlations shape inclusion dynamics. We test our model on two empirical networks of cultural production: the correspondence of the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) and contemporary global music collaborations. In both cases, heterophily enhances the centrality of minorities, albeit the enhancement depends on the attributes' internal composition and interdependence. Our findings demonstrate that inclusion policies must account for the multidimensional nature of social identities, and can open alternative and non-trivial pathways toward more equitable visibility in social systems.",

The result is a two-tier schema comprising 38 elementary bias types, arranged in six functional families and visualised as a \"table of media-bias elements\". For each type we supply a definition, real-world examples, cognitive and societal drivers, and guidance for recognition.

This study compared suicidal-related and non-suicidal sessions within a general youth chatline to identify session characteristics and worker skills associated with positive outcomes. Methods: We analyzed 1,710 chat sessions (202,336 messages) from QuickChat, a Singapore youth chatline between 2016 and 2020. Large language models classified sessions as suicidal or self-harm related (n=406, 24%) or non-suicidal (n=1,304, 76%). User-reported outcomes measured service quality and coping ability. Twelve therapeutic skills were coded from 79,587 worker messages. Multilevel regression models examined skill-outcome associations. Results: Suicidal-related sessions were significantly longer, contained more messages, and yielded lower outcomes. Suicidal ideation was most prevalent (85%), followed by self-harm (43%). In suicidal sessions, normalization demonstrated the strongest associations with all outcomes, followed by teaching/psychoeducation and making strengths explicit. These patterns differed substantially from non-suicidal sessions. Conclusion: Suicidal-related sessions within general chatlines demand greater engagement and differentiated responses from workers. Normalization and psychoeducation emerge as effective techniques for improving outcomes in suicidal chats. These findings provide actionable guidance for training frontline workers in general youth services.",

Tracing the transition from platforms to AI, we identify interlinked economic, epistemic, and political shifts. Economically, AI emerges within platform-based rentier capitalism but reconfigures the monopoly mechanisms on which its accumulation depends. Epistemically, LLMs mark a shift from predictive to generative epistemics, entangling theory formation and knowledge production with private research-as-a-service infrastructures. Politically, governance shifts from data politics to alignment politics: from shaping visibility to shaping what can be said, thought, and imagined. Together, these transformations signal a qualitative shift in mediation—from governing interaction to governing cognition itself—and call for a Critical AI Studies.",

We aim to provide updated, comparative evidence on the prevalence of frequent contact (including digital) and close proximity between older parents and their children, and to assess how measurement choices affect cross-national patterns in Europe. Methods. We use data on 23 European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe wave 9 (2021–2022) and the European Social Survey round 10 (2020–2022) to estimate the prevalence of frequent contact and close proximity across different approaches: most-contacted versus random child, any versus mode-specific contact, distance versus travel-time thresholds. Cross-national coherence is assessed with Spearman rank correlations and Kendall’s W. Results. We find a pronounced regional gradient: Southern Europe shows the highest levels of frequent contact and close proximity, Nordic and Continental countries the lowest, and Eastern Europe are in-between with internal heterogeneity. Digital communication is part of the intergenerational repertoire, albeit not clearly geographically patterned. Face-to-face and phone contacts remain dominant; texting is less widespread, while video calls remain rare. Measurement choices substantially shift prevalence levels but much less the ranking of countries that remains consistent also when adjusting for socio-demographics. Discussion. We document persistent family-regime differences and highlight digital contact as a supplementary facet of associational solidarity. Results point to risks of a double exclusion for older adults who lack face-to-face contact and cannot exploit digital tools and underscore that survey design choices matter for levels but not ranking-based comparisons, supporting the use of random-child items in general surveys.",

We introduce the Criminal Nucleation Framework to model the emergence and persistence of criminal cells through three dimensions: the institutional activation barrier (ΔG), the critical organizational size (r*), and the growth constant (k). Empirical validation shows a structural rupture between 2007 and 2010, where homicide rates shifted from a stable regime (8.5–10 per 100k) to a chronic state (25–29 per 100k). By operationalizing a comparative Kinetic Risk Index (R = k/ΔG), the framework classifies cities into distinct systemic states rather than providing point predictions. The findings suggest that once a system exhibits hysteresis, reactive force is structurally insufficient; instead, policy must focus on increasing the activation barrier to prevent spontaneous criminal formation.",

To advance this debate, we introduce a measure for quantifying the proportion of systematic variance in panel data attributable to intrapersonal change.

This article argues that machine learning systems now operate as generative co-authors, participating directly in everyday meaning-making practices. Building on postmodern and digimodern accounts, it conceptualizes a historical shift toward asymmetrical co-production in which AI systems actively shape identity, agency, and collective belonging. Through theoretical genealogy and synthesis of empirical literature on influencer culture, three interrelated dimensions are elaborated: algorithmic co-authorship of selfhood, distributed agency between human intention and computational prediction, and algorithmically mediated retribalization. The framework specifies how AI’s generative role operates within platform-based political economies, offering new conceptual vocabulary for understanding how machine learning reconfigures authorship, decision-making, and community formation under contemporary digital conditions.",

Drawing on nine waves of German panel data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (2011–2022), I demonstrate that the “Germanness” of parental networks shapes youth respondents’ majority- group ties in adolescence, and illustrate how these social inheritances influence the Germanness of adolescent networks during the transition to early adulthood. By Wave 9, when most respondents are in their late 20s, the Germanness of social networks is closely linked to political preferences: native majorities with more German-centric networks are less likely to support left-wing parties, while the inverse is true for most of their immigrant-origin peers. These patterns reflect distinct but complementary mechanisms: for immigrants and their descendants, majority ties signal structural assimilation into “mainstream” political culture and convergence with liberal-cosmopolitan norms; for natives, ethnically diverse social networks reinforce enculturation into progressive political communities. Overall, these findings show that political socialisation operates not only through the transmission of beliefs and cultural orientations, but through the concomitant reproduction of social environments.",

        "abstract": "Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are increasingly used by diverse countries to support large-scale economic development. However, limited evidence exists regarding their national effects. I investigate SWF effects on GDP per capita ($ US 2024) and domestic savings share of GDP in Norway and Singapore, the two open economies with the largest SWFs, and Australia, a negative control unit with a much smaller SWF. The analysis estimates that Norway’s Government Pension Fund SWF added $816,089 per capita over the analysis period ($28,141/Year) to resource-rent pruned GDP per capita and 9.69% to domestic saving share of GDP (1995-2023). Singapore’s Temasek global SWF investments added $472,605 per capita over the analysis period ($22,505/Year) and 14.42% to domestic savings share of GDP (2003-2023). As expected, Australia’s smaller SWF had no significant effect on GDP. These synthetic control analysis estimates are robust to in-place and time placebos and negative control outcomes. The findings indicate that robust mandatory SWF-steered savings in open economies can accelerate economic growth beyond standard Solow model steady state equilibrium by adding a non-depreciating compound growth function to domestic investment.",

        "abstract": "Conceptions of nature are not immune to the parameters of the social world. Situating pedagogical texts historically and assessing their current implications is to attempt taking their proper measure. The lenses of purity, pollution, touch, taste, space, and boundaries have to be renegotiated, resisted and re-formed to conceptualize an alternative ecological world. Alternative visions of stories, histories, skills, technologies, and priorities can then be mapped and archived as a possibility, first of all, of the existence of different ways of living and, second of all, as tools ready to challenge the existing dominant conception. Language plays a crucial role in this enterprise. It is a point of departure in the journey of reimagination. This paper, through critical discourse analysis of two sets of texts—an alternative curriculum called the ‘Climate Change Curriculum’ and an interactive curriculum called ‘The Circular Classroom’—seeks to map the contours of discourse that manifest in the texts and the possible outlook it furthers. The discourse around the environment works with the categories of possession, physicality, resources, and boundaries. Even the discourse of environmental justice operates within these frames. No systems of dominant discourse function in a vacuum, but construct and prop each other, making mapping out of heterogeneous, dynamic and plural histories of environmental education curriculum a crucial first step.",

        "abstract": "Sustainability competitions are widely used as soft governance instruments, yet organisational engagement varies considerably. This study explains this variation by examining managerial sensemaking. Drawing on interviews with senior managers from 16 European destinations, the study shows that engagement is shaped by how tourist destination managers interpret the purpose and relevance of competitions through organisational identity orientations. Identity orientations determine whether competitions are treated as meaningful governance mechanisms or as marginal compliance or reputational exercises. We identify five sensemaking configurations that explain variation between substantive, learning-oriented engagement and selective or symbolic responses, and show that these configurations may shift over time as organisational experiences and contexts change.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the disconnect between sustainability rhetoric and fiscal practice in the Balearic Islands' tourism tax policy (Spain). Using a novel AI-assisted method, we analyse 297 tax-funded projects worth €845.8 million and 357 civil society proposals from 2016–2025. Findings reveal a shift from eco-social aims toward a green growth agenda, prioritising competitiveness over redistribution or ecological limits. Despite growing public demand for tourism degrowth and justice, governance structures marginalise civic influence. The study highlights how sustainability language is co-opted to legitimise expansion, raising concerns about greenwashing. We argue for redesigning tourism taxes with participatory governance, progressive criteria, and sufficiency-based goals. This approach can transform tourism fiscal tools into genuine levers for environmental justice and systemic transition.",

        "created": "2026-01-15",
        "abstract": "Modernization theories predict increasing gender-egalitarian attitudes among younger cohorts. Yet, recent evidence points to substantial gender polarization within Generation Z. This short paper provides a systematic, cross-national and multidimensional analysis of gender differences in gender equality attitudes among Generation Z in Europe. Using microdata from six large-scale surveys, covering 82,187 individuals (born 1995–2009) across 24 European countries, we assess gender gaps across eight attitudinal dimensions of gender equality. We ask how attitudes differ by gender, how these gaps vary across countries, and how they relate to country-level gender equality. Our findings reveal widespread gender gaps, with young women consistently expressing more egalitarian views than young men. However, the magnitude of these gaps vary across countries and dimensions. Gender gaps are comparatively smaller for gender role norms, such as shared parenting, but larger for attitudes toward labor market fairness, perceptions of discrimination, and the salience of gender equality. Relating these patterns to the 2024 Gender Equality Index reveals that the relationship is not strictly linear across outcomes. Together, these findings challenge linear modernization narratives and underscore the importance of contextualized and multidimensional perspectives on gender equality attitudes among Generation Z.",

        "abstract": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine challenges the liberal international order and tests the capacity of Western democracies to maintain long-term military and financial aid for Ukraine in a foreign war. Understanding whether governments’ pledges of resolve are backed by their citizens is crucial for the credibility of these commitments. Here we show, based on survey experiments with 10,011 respondents in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy, that these countries’ publics share a similar pattern of preferences. In all countries, citizens strongly endorse Ukraine’s sovereignty and self-determination while weighing human suffering and conflict escalation risk, but less so economic costs. However, within countries, attitudes are polarized: roughly one quarter of citizens with pro-Western orientations show firm resolve, whereas another quarter with anti-Western views remain largely indifferent to political outcomes for Ukraine. These divisions indicate that democratic party competition could constrain the unity and durability of Western resolve against autocratic aggression.",

        "abstract": "Environmental KPIs have long been analysed as socio-technical devices—abstractions, inscriptions, and instruments of action at a distance—rather than as neutral representations of external realities. This article extends that line of inquiry by treating KPIs as technical objects in Simondon’s sense: individuating entities whose stability depends on the construction of an associated milieu of metadata, identifiers, validation routines, and machine-readable infrastructures. Drawing on Simondon’s account of technical individuation and Hui’s notion of digital objects, I reconstruct the concretisation of climate KPIs in European sustainability reporting from avoided-emissions claims to scenario-indexed pathways, sectoral intensities, and ESRS-aligned transition-plan disclosures designed for downstream recomputation. I contrast this trajectory with biodiversity disclosure, where indicators often remain procedural and delegative, outsourcing commensuration to future modelling capacities and to spatial “sensitivity layers” that are still missing or unevenly implemented across platforms. A comparison with impairment-testing sensitivities in financial reporting specifies what a mature associated milieu looks like: discounting conventions and parameter disclosures that render uncertainty governable, auditable, and contestable. The contemporary crisis of sustainability reporting is therefore less a deficit of data than a struggle over the technical milieus—scenarios, taxonomies, identifiers, and platform stacks—through which comparability, auditability, and collective steering are made possible.",

        "abstract": "Puri Agung Ubud is one of the traditional Balinese palaces that functions as a living cultural heritage (living monument) as well as an important cultural tourism attraction in Ubud, Gianyar. The pressure of modern tourism has encouraged various forms of architectural adaptation, both in spatial function, physical form, materials, and socio-cultural utilization patterns within the palace. This study aims to identify architectural adaptation strategies that occur at Puri Agung Ubud, analyze their impact on cultural values and traditional architecture, and formulate conservation directions that are integrated with the development of sustainable cultural tourism. The research method used is descriptive qualitative through field observations, physical measurements, visual documentation, in-depth interviews with puri administrators and cultural figures, and analysis of relevant documents. The analysis is carried out by linking the concepts of Tri Mandala, Sanga Mandala, and Tri Hita Karana to the puri's spatial system, and applying Schmidt &amp; Austin's typology of adaptation strategies (adjustable, versatile, refitable, convertible, scalable, movable) to four main palebahan: Ancak Saji, Semanggen, Rangki, and Saren Agung. The results of this study indicate that Puri Agung Ubud is able to maintain its traditional spatial macrostructure and sacred-cosmological orientation, while selectively adapting through changes in spatial functions, hybrid construction techniques, and transformation of architectural elements to accommodate tourism needs, without completely eliminating its authentic value. The main findings indicate that controlled adaptation based on critical conservation has the potential to strengthen the palace's sustainability as a cultural heritage, on the one hand by maintaining traditional practices and on the other hand by opening economic and educational opportunities through cultural tourism. This article offers a framework for architectural adaptation strategies for similar cultural heritage sites in Bali that face similar pressures from global tourism.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the transformative role lighthouses played in shaping China’s 19th-century maritime trade. In the aftermath of the Opium War and the opening of international treaty ports, the Chinese Maritime Customs Service (CMC), under the leadership of Robert Hart, launched a concerted effort to illuminate the nation’s dark and hazardous coastline. By examining annual trade reports alongside the construction dates and locations of new lighthouses, I discovered that ports such as Shanghai, Chinkiang, and Kiukiang saw increases in commercial activity, often doubling or even tripling annual trade volume after the installation of navigational aids. To further support this correlation, this paper draws on qualitative sources, including commissioner reports, lighthouse keeper accounts, and decennial customs records, to provide firsthand insights into how lighthouses functioned not only as safety mechanisms but also as symbols of state authority. They deterred local resistance, reinforced imperial presence, and contributed to a more secure and predictable maritime environment. In doing so, lighthouses helped establish reliable channels for international commerce, reducing the risk of shipwreck or cargo loss and ultimately fostering trust in China’s coastal trade routes.",

        "abstract": "Background: Israel’s genocide in the Gaza Strip has killed 7.9% of the population, and thousands of Palestinians have faced myriad forms of violence and imminent threats to life, including physical injuries from ballistics, home demolitions, and torture. These highly traumatic conditions pose severe psychological threats to Palestinians and may have reverberating effects in neighboring Arab countries. This scoping review aimed to examine the direct and indirect mental health consequences of Israel’s genocidal assault on Gazans, Palestinian citizens outside of Gaza, and populations in neighboring Arab countries and also investigated processes of coping and resilience among Palestinians. Methods: Following (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, 42 articles, which were published after October 2023, were identified from five major search engines, including PubMed, Scopus, SpringerLink, Proquest, and Google Scholar. Studies investigated the psychological impacts of the 2023 genocide in Gaza, and their results were categorized into three groups: psychological impacts of wars, resilience, and coping strategies studies under war circumstances. Results: Findings revealed devastating mental health effects due to the genocide, with Gazans experiencing the most extreme outcomes. Gazan samples reported alarmingly high prevalence rates of mental health symptoms, including depression (72.7-99.5%), anxiety (65.0-99.7%), and PTSD (63.4-83.5%), which were the highest among all examined groups. Resilience and coping resources among Palestinians included cognitive strategies, family and social support, and religion. Conclusion: These findings highlight the large-scale psychological consequences of the 2023 Gazan genocide and underscores the urgent need for emergency mental health interventions in Palestine. Immediate action is necessary to prevent further psychological damage from the genocide and avert an irreversible humanitarian catastrophe.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the social and regulatory implications of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on its rapid popularization and disruptive potential. It adopts a qualitative, exploratory approach grounded in bibliographic and documentary research, with descriptive-analytical examination of international and national reports and regulatory frameworks. The paper contextualizes AI as a global debate topic present in multilateral organizations, educational environments, and corporate strategies, highlighting tensions between technological progress and social structures. It discusses the impact of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, on professional markets, education, and governance. International regulatory initiatives are analyzed, including the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the United Kingdom’s National AI Strategy, and U.S. actions to consolidate leadership in research and development. In Brazil, the study reviews the legislative trajectory culminating in Bill No. 2,338/2023, which proposes principles, rights, risk classification, and governance mechanisms for AI systems. Ethical dimensions—such as transparency, accountability, bias mitigation, and fairness—are addressed, along with challenges in translating normative concepts into algorithmic frameworks. The paper also explores controversies surrounding copyright and remuneration for creators whose works train AI models, as well as risks related to disinformation, deepfakes, and national security. It concludes by advocating adaptive regulation, inclusive governance, and continuous social dialogue in light of emerging issues concerning authorship, authenticity, and equitable labor transitions in the era of generative AI.",

        "authors": "Shuja Shakir",
        "created": "2026-01-08",
        "abstract": "In digital capitalism, attention is often regarded as a measurable economic resource, although its conceptual definition remains unstable across various scientific disciplines. This study contends that quantifying attention functions not as an impartial measurement but as a fundamental epistemic framework that dictates what can be understood about attention. By examining proxy-based metrics such as engagement and watch time, it illustrates how these computable indicators gain authoritative status within platform infrastructures, ultimately defining attention rather than merely estimating it. Through an exploration of YouTube’s watch-time economy, this study reveals how a proxy metric is integrated into feedback loops that connect algorithmic optimization, creator efforts, and user actions, creating a self-perpetuating epistemic cycle in which the metric shapes the reality it purports to measure. In this system, issues such as cognitive overload, creative exhaustion, and attentional fatigue do not manifest as quantifiable costs but arise as epistemic externalities—systematically produced yet obscured by the metric’s one-sided logic of accumulation. This study further asserts that this epistemic imbalance extends beyond individual platforms, altering the conditions of democratic attention. The forms of attention crucial to democratic life–sustained, integrative, and deliberative–remain inherently unquantifiable within engagement-focused systems and are thus excluded from institutional recognition and value. Consequently, attention quantification is not merely an economic tactic but a transformation of democracy’s epistemic foundations. Addressing these impacts necessitates interrogating the epistemic authority of proxy-based metrics rather than refining them within the existing framework.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the link between economic performance and multidimensional well-being in the Italian context using a combination of the ISTAT BES approach (Benessere Equo e Sostenibile) and machine learning and clustering analysis. On the basis of a dataset of 19 Italian regions and the Autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano from 2012 to 2023, it will be examined how the three BES components—Benessere (B), Equità (E), and Sostenibilità (S)—are intertwined with the Gross Domestic Product of the regions. Regarding the Benessere (B) component of well-being, the Gross Domestic Product will be analyzed using a regression approach of the K-Nearest Neighbors type to reveal the complex linkages between health outcomes, education outcomes, working conditions, social participation, and economic performance. The clustering of the B indicators and the Gross Domestic Product will be done using Hierarchical Clustering analysis to identify homogeneous territories characterized by different levels of quality of life and economic prosperity. Regarding the Equità (E) component of well-being, the regression analysis will be done using the Boosting algorithm to model the linkages between the Gross Domestic Product and the indicators of income distribution, poverty, material deprivation, and inclusion in the labor market. Boosting regression analysis will be particularly useful for this purpose since it models the complex interactions and thresholds of social and economic inequalities. Hierarchical Clustering analysis will be applied to identify the territories characterized by different levels of equity and economic growth. Regarding the Sostenibilità (S) component of well-being, the Gross Domestic Product will be modeled using Boosting regression analysis to reveal the very complex linkages between the economic performance of the territories and the indicators of environmental quality, risk of climate change, innovation outcomes, and the quality of public services. For this purpose, the analysis will use the Random Forest algorithm to identify the territories characterized by different levels of sustainability and economic performance. The analysis will show that the BES approach provides a very useful framework to identify the very different levels of linkages between the economic performance of the territories and the outcomes of the BES approach. The analysis will provide evidence that the BES approach is a very useful framework for the analysis of the linkages between the economic performance of the territories and the outcomes of the BES approach.",

In the Chinese case, the governance of arbitration is placed within a regulatory arena driven by administrative supervision, judicialization of arbitration procedures, and deep judicial review, causing a tension between contract principles. In this study, a legal and development orientation is adopted to examine the Chinese arbitration system, arguing that the above tension is part of a broader challenge faced by transitional approaches to harmonize dispute resolution practices and market governance and rule of law aspirations. It proposes an institutional reform led by a conceptual map of three core principles: decreasing administrative supervision over arbitration governance in terms of market reform principles; adjusting the adversary practices of litigation within arbitration governance in terms of empowerment and personal legislation; and evolving a judicial supervision approach featuring a teamwork scheme and preferential procedural analysis over deep judicial interventionism. The analysis offers a contribution to a discourse on international comparisons of arbitration governance and development.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic study of the “Eight-Cord Pattern Pottery Plate” unearthed from the Liu Linxi site in Hubei Province, arguing that it serves as the material prototype of the lost ancient canonical text, the Ba Suo. The pottery plate constructs a standard eight-direction spatial framework through its orderly “eight-cord pattern,” representing the archetype of the “Eight Trigrams Plate.” Its symbol system precisely encodes the “Eight Solar Terms,” including the two equinoxes, two solstices, and the four seasonal commencements, constituting a sophisticated “solar calendar.” Furthermore, through unique symbolic combinations such as “Wu (五)-Tian (田),” it transforms astronomical nodes into rigid agricultural instructions, forming a “Charter of Agricultural Timings.” This research achieves a complete mutual verification between the artifact and the Ba Suo as recorded in later texts (“the theory of the Eight Trigrams, seeking its meaning”) from the triple dimensions of “name, substance, and meaning.” The study reveals that the “Eight-Cord Pattern Pottery Plate” is not a divination instrument, but rather a “pre-literary comprehensive codex” integrating cosmology, scientific observation, and administrative decree. It signifies that around 7000 years ago, Chinese civilization had achieved a crucial leap from mystical symbols to rational governance, significantly predating the empirical evidence for systematic knowledge and advanced governance models in Chinese civilization.",

        "abstract": "Reports of online grooming, sexual extortion, and child sexual abuse material have increased markedly. Public reactions to news stories frequently point to inattentive parenting as the cause, even though studies show that many offenses are committed by people the child already knows, including juvenile peers and family members, and that today’s parents are far more involved in children’s daily lives than those of past generations. This chapter examines why public conversations about online crimes against children often attribute blame to neglectful parenting despite evidence of more complicated situations. The chapter first reviews what is currently known about family environments, parenting practices, and online children victimization, then draws on the Life Course Perspective for insight on online risks and public perceptions of them. From this framework, children’s online vulnerability is less a function of parental vigilance than of current historical contexts including sociocultural lag. As such, preventative programs must take into account these factors. Additional Life Course principles help explain why families and observers may struggle to understand what it means to “protect children online.” The aim is to view family-level prevention, and calls for it, within social and technological systems rather than treating parents, or any other single group, as a primary line of defense against online child predation.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of web-based data collection, researchers are increasingly exploring how to measure cognition online, including in web surveys and video interviews. This paper provides empirical evidence on mode effects (web, in-person, video interviewing) in the measurement of cognitive abilities using the TestMyBrain Backward Digit Span test (an immediate serial recall task) among adults age 20-40 years in England. Participants completed surveys including the same cognitive test at two time points two weeks apart and were randomly allocated to mode at each wave. The 1,692 wave 1 respondents and 1,510 wave 2 respondents were analysed using mixed effects models to estimate mode effects relating to several assessment outcomes. We found that participation by web was associated with a higher likelihood of an incomplete assessment relative to both in-person and video interviewing, suggesting that the presence of an interviewer – even if not physically present as in video interviewing – enhances the likelihood of a successfully completed test. For participants who completed the cognitive assessment, we found no evidence that the observed mean scores differed by mode, though this appeared to mask some heterogeneity. Although based on small numbers, there was a trend for both web and video respondents to be more likely to obtain the highest test scores than those participating in-person. This is consistent with prior suggestions that individuals in modes where there is limited or no interviewer presence are more likely to cheat. Mean test scores were consistently higher at wave 2 than at wave 1, with this ‘retest gain’ differing little by mode. These findings contribute to the limited literature on mode effects in cognitive assessment and offer valuable insights for researchers designing and analysing mixed-mode studies.",

        "abstract": "This paper challenges the conventional dualism of \"real versus digital,\" proposing a state of interpenetration where both domains are inseparably integrated within human cognition. Utilizing sense-making theory, the author argues that meaning is generated through memory chains that do not fundamentally distinguish between physical and digital experiences. To systematically analyze this integration, the research applies the Quatro Dynamic Thinking model, which explores the four dimensions of depth, breadth, relationships, and time. The paper examines how interpenetration manifests in practical domains such as healthcare, labor, and social problem-solving, revealing a transition from digital tools to embodied cognitive extensions. It elucidates a new mode of human existence within the \"interreal world,\" where psychological and social realities often supersede traditional ontological boundaries. While acknowledging the benefits of this fusion, the paper warns of risks like the \"accumulation of cognitive debt\" and the atrophy of thinking skills due to AI dependency. Ultimately, it advocates for cultivating multidimensional thinking to ensure humans remain the primary agents of meaning-making in an increasingly digitalized reality",

        "abstract": "Affordable housing remains a critical development challenge in rapidly urbanizing cities, particularly in developing economies. Nairobi Metropolis continues to experience a persistent housing deficit characterized by project delays, cost overruns, quality compromises, and occasional structural failures, despite sustained public and private sector interventions. This study examined the influence of Environmental Assessment Design as a project design practice on the implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi Metropolis, Kenya, and further assessed the moderating role of the Regulatory Framework on this relationship. Anchored on a pragmatist research philosophy, the study adopted a descriptive and explanatory research design, utilizing quantitative methods. Primary data were collected from key stakeholders involved in affordable housing projects, including project managers, consultants, contractors, and regulatory officers. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test both direct and moderating effects. The findings revealed that Environmental Assessment Design had a statistically significant positive influence on the implementation of affordable housing projects, explaining 26.9% of the variance in implementation outcomes. When the Regulatory Framework was introduced as a moderating variable, the explanatory power of the model increased substantially to 56.8%, indicating a strong enhancement effect. The interaction between Environmental Assessment Design and the Regulatory Framework was positive and significant, confirming that effective regulatory support strengthened the impact of environmental assessment practices on project implementation. The study concluded that successful implementation of affordable housing projects is not only dependent on sound environmental and technical design but is significantly shaped by the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks. Strengthening environmental assessment processes alongside coherent, well-enforced regulatory mechanisms is therefore critical for improving project delivery. The study recommends enhanced regulatory coordination, streamlined approval processes, and capacity building for project and regulatory institutions. Further research is suggested across other metropolitan counties, with additional moderating variables and longitudinal designs to enrich understanding of sustainable affordable housing implementation.",

        "abstract": "Forming an understanding of the extent to which individuals realise their short-term fertility intentions is essential in terms of grasping the dynamics behind persistently low fertility in Europe. This study examines the realisation of fertility intentions within a three-year period across four Central European countries (Czechia, Poland, Austria and Germany) employing data from the two waves of the Generations and Gender Survey (2005–2015). The study focuses on men and women aged 18–39 and includes both childless individuals and parents aimed at capturing differences in terms of the realisation of fertility intentions at distinct stages of the family life course. Its main contribution lies in examining whether and how the age of the youngest child is associated with the realisation of the fertility intentions of parents. The results reveal that the odds of parents realising their fertility intentions decline substantially as the youngest child grows older, thus suggesting the existence of a relatively narrow time window following a birth for the realisation of intentions to have another child, a factor that has important implications for the design of (tempo-related) family policies. In addition, the study shows that while economic conditions influence the realisation of short-term fertility intentions to have a child for childless individuals, they lose their significance for parents. By uncovering the central role of the child’s age in terms of the realisation of fertility intentions, this study contributes to the demographic research on timing and parity-specific fertility behaviour and has important implications for the formation of family policies aimed at supporting higher-order (especially second) births.",

        "abstract": "Affordable housing has become a major concern to many governments. The debate in this area has extremely grown both nationally and internationally after a series of recorded ballooning of population and the mushrooming of informal settlements in the environs of our cities and towns. This study seeks to explore the project design and implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. The objectives considered in this study are: To establish the influence of Project Financing Design and to check the moderating role of Regulatory framework between Project design and the implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. To achieve the set objectives, the study develops research hypotheses and was statistically tested at α = 0.05. The theories on which the study was hinged are stakeholder’s theory and open system theory. The study adopts a descriptive research design, and used both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The study looked at a population of 11 affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis with 101,565 number of units. Census sampling used a sample of 220 professionals working on the affordable housing projects. These officials are directly involved with project design and the implementation of affordable housing in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. The study used open-ended and closed-ended questionnaire as the main mode of data collection. Primary data was collected using structured questionnaires. Secondary data was collected from institutional documents, State Department of Housing and Urban Development publications, and relevant publications in referred journals. The collected data was edited, coded and entered into SPSS software for analysis. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. In particular, Regression Analysis was used to investigate the relationships between hypothesized variables. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was also used to investigate whether independent variables have a combined effect on the dependent variable. The data was analyzed through the use of descriptive statistics. ANOVA, t-test, Pearson correlation, p- values and coefficient of determination. Data was presented using frequency tables, figures, graphs and pie charts. This study examined the factors influencing affordable housing implementation in Nairobi metropolis, focusing on Project Financing Design and Regulatory Framework. The research found that all these factors significantly impact housing project success, with Project Financing Design having the strongest positive effect (29.8% increase per unit improvement). The study emphasizes the importance of integrating environmental considerations, developing robust financing strategies, streamlining regulatory processes, and ensuring effective technical planning in housing initiatives.",

        "abstract": "Straightlining, (nearly) identical responses in multi-item batteries, is among the most widely used indicators of satisficing. However, straightlining does not necessarily reflect low-quality responses; it can also result from genuine similar attitudes or behaviors. We differentiate between plausible straightlining batteries, where uniform responses are reasonable given specific question characteristics and content, and implausible straightlining batteries, where uniform responding is not expected and most likely signals satisficing. Using data from the GESIS Panel.pop, a mixed-mode probability-based panel in Germany, we leverage a layout change that transitioned multi-item batteries from matrix to single-item formats to study plausible and implausible straightlining. Our findings, based on mixed-effects logistic regression models, indicate that respondents are significantly more likely to straightline on plausible than on implausible batteries. While question format does not affect straightlining overall, single-item formats are associated with less straightlining on implausible batteries but more on plausible batteries. Additional analyses show that web respondents are less likely to straightline than mail respondents, and this mode effect is more pronounced in single-item formats. Smartphone respondents are more likely to straightline than desktop or tablet respondents, particularly on implausible straightlining batteries. These results highlight the importance of considering question characteristics and content when using straightlining as an indicator of satisficing to avoid flagging genuine responses as low-quality data.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To enhance the understanding of different survey questions and the opportunities they provide to measure fear of crime as a latent trait, examining both crime-type and consequence items. Methods: Items from five surveys used in the Stockholm Region were coded into content areas. Cognitive interviews (n = 19) were analysed for response processes. Rasch analyses were conducted on the Swedish Crime Survey (n = 4,264) and the City of Stockholm Crime Survey (n = 7,333). Results: The surveys covered overlapping topics but used distinct phrasings. Response comprehension was generally adequate, yet some terms were interpreted differently. Respondents found it difficult to isolate fear of crime from other motives in the consequence items. There was no clear advantage to either frequency- or consequence-framed items, whereas intensity stems imposed a lower response burden. Psychometrically, unidimensional solutions were hard to achieve for either crime type or consequence item sets. The evidence suggests heterogeneity across population groups. Conclusions: Current practice involves both strengths and weaknesses. This study suggests paths toward enhanced measurement of the fear of crime. Measuring fear of crime as a single, invariant latent trait is far from straightforward. The heterogeneity of responses across population groups indicates that different groups evaluate their fear of crime types and consequences differently, challenging the assumption of unidimensionality. However, the cognitive interviews suggest ways to clarify item wording and reduce respondent burden.",

Although significant for understanding human evolution, the rise of industrialized mass production has reduced the need for handicraft practices and their inter-generational transmission in daily life. This study thus examines toolmaking skill acquisition in 170 non-industrial societies through a comprehensive compilation and coding of ethnographic text data using the eHRAF World Cultures. Grounded in the cultural evolution theory (CET), this descriptive analysis addresses six fundamental questions: what skills are most frequently learned, who transmits this knowledge, where skill acquisition takes place, when learning occurs developmentally, how skills are acquired, and why specific individuals are chosen as models. The most important finding addresses the “why” question of major transmission biases involved in the toolmaking skill acquisition, highlighting the dominant role of kin-based transmission bias. This provides an empirical recalibration to CET modeling studies, which have traditionally emphasized conformist and success/prestige-based biases. Moreover, this project creates a valuable foundation for exploring patterns in cultural learning and technological practices across societies featuring diverse subsistence strategies, while also providing a reference framework for archaeological interpretations of past learning dynamics.",

        "abstract": "A documented mental health crisis affects 33% of Indonesian adolescents, with only 2.6% accessing professional services. Secondary education systems demonstrate persistent gaps between identified mental health needs and institutional capacity to respond. This study employs autoethnographic analysis integrated with systematic engagement of peer-reviewed literature to examine institutional mechanisms through which policy failures cascade into individual psychological distress. Research reveals that surveillance failures are not implementation gaps but structurally produced through educational paternalism, conformity-enforcing social systems, chronic cognitive dissonance in critical thinkers, cognitive impairment resulting from burnout, suppression of authentic identity, and systematic teacher mental health literacy deficits. The analysis yields three principal contributions: (1) a cascading crisis model demonstrating how structural policy failures transmit through institutional, social, cognitive, and psychological levels; (2) reconceptualization of anxiety and critical thinking as accurate threat detection rather than individual pathology in genuinely toxic environments; and (3) autoethnographic evidence of student perspective systematically absent from policy discourse. Methodologically, the study demonstrates autoethnography's capacity to generate institutional knowledge through insider access to dynamics invisible to conventional research methods. The research generalizes patterns identified across multiple Indonesian secondary education contexts, with policy implications for mandatory educator mental health literacy training, prevention-oriented rather than crisis-driven systems, embedding mental health within educational policy infrastructure, and substantive inclusion of student voice in program design. The study makes urgent case that psychological harm documented in adolescent populations is not inevitable consequence of schooling but result of specific institutional choices choices amenable to reform.",

        "abstract": "Embodied and relational approaches to socio-emotional development increasingly emphasize lived experience, interaction, and situated awareness, yet few frameworks systematically integrate movement-based practices with established psychotherapeutic theory. This theoretical review examines the convergence between Argentine Tango (tango) and Gestalt Therapy (GT), proposing an embodied, relational framework for socio-emotional development and relational awareness. Tango is conceptualized as an improvisational, dyadic practice that operationalizes core GT principles, including contact, field regulation, phenomenological awareness, experiential cycling, and creative adjustment. Drawing on empirical findings from psychology, neuroscience, and movement science, the review synthesizes evidence indicating that tango participation supports emotional regulation, empathy, social bonding, embodied awareness, and motor-cognitive integration. Through this synthesis, tango is positioned as a structured somatic laboratory for experiential GT processes and relational learning, offering a concrete context in which therapeutic mechanisms unfold in vivo. Despite promising outcomes, existing research remains predominantly outcome-focused, and systematic, process-oriented investigation of tango’s specific mechanisms of change is limited. This framework establishes a foundation for future interdisciplinary research and applied exploration of tango-informed GT practice across therapeutic, educational, and movement-based contexts.",

Our analysis comprehensively covers physical, psychological, sexual, and controlling behaviours. The effect of this review is a novel hierarchical typology of narratives that frame and justify abuse, which are then analysed through the lens of Bandura’s eight mechanisms of moral disengagement (MD). The core argument proposes that the widespread persistence of IPV is sustained by a system of social coherence, not solely individual pathology. Legitimization operates hierarchically: fundamental societal ideologies provide the foundational Moral Justification, enabling the subsequent activation of individual MD strategies (specifically Dehumanization, Attribution of Blame, and Diffusion of Responsibility) by perpetrators. Crucially, the MD framework is extended to show that these narratives are also mobilized by external observers and social institutions to manage moral discomfort and maintain a predictable social order through defensive attribution and the Belief in a Just World. This model demonstrates that effective prevention must target the underlying cultural narratives and the hierarchical moral architecture that actively license these moral exemptions.",

        "abstract": "The implications of climate change are becoming increasingly visible through its multifaceted effects, including the rising frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures and weather events such as floods, droughts and sea level rise. This study integrates longitudinal survey data from Understanding Society (2009–2023) with high-resolution flood and temperature records across the United Kingdom to examine how exposure to heatwaves and floods relates to the likelihood of conception among childless individuals of reproductive age. Using monthly-level discrete-time event history models, the analysis accounts for demographic, socio-economic, and contextual confounders, and further investigates the moderating role of pre-existing climate change attitudes and behaviours. The results show that exposure to both types of natural hazards is associated with a temporary reduction in the monthly probability of conception. Heatwaves, in particular, show a strong and highly significant association, with conception probabilities declining sharply during months of exposure. Floods show a weaker yet still negative association, observed in the six months immediately following the event. Furthermore, environmental behaviours appear to play a moderating role in the case of floods: only individuals reporting environmentally friendly behaviours experience a temporary decline in conception probabilities after flood exposure, followed by a modest rebound thereafter. By uniquely combining individual-level panel data with localized climate information, this study goes beyond intention-based analyses to reveal how climate shocks relate to actual fertility behaviour. Overall, these findings demonstrate that climate change constitutes not only an environmental or economic challenge, but also a demographic one, with meaningful implications for fertility behaviours.",

        "abstract": "Traditional catastrophe bonds allow jurisdictions to insure against major disasters when a sponsor can afford regular coupon payments but cannot afford a large, unexpected disaster. Wealthy national governments can afford both routine payments to prepare for and prevent natural disasters and pandemics, and can afford much larger stimulus and relief payments when they occur, with the former being more cost effective, but the latter having much greater political support. Private preparation for major natural disasters is complicated by laws and social norms against price-gouging that discourage private stockpiling. We argue that governments could ensure efficient, market-driven preparations for many forms of disasters, including pandemics, by entering contingent purchasing contracts that follow the risk-transfer logic of ‘reverse catastrophe bonds.’ I In this model, private suppliers pay for the creation and maintenance of medical countermeasures and other disaster-ready supplies in exchange for the government sponsor agreeing to purchase such private stockpiles at a set premium when a disaster occurs. This would allow governments to avoid unpopular spending on disaster stockpiling, increase societal levels of stockpiling, incentivize private actors to predict and prepare for disasters, and allow the government to distribute emergency goods via social rather than market mechanisms during disasters or pandemics. This model is a form of contingent purchasing agreement related to, but distinct from, advance market commitments. Unlike AMCs, it does not rely on predefined target product profiles or ex ante quantity commitments. This paper also discusses how private philanthropy could play a catalytic role in developing and piloting versions of this proposal.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a proof-of-concept for the Researcher-As-Obstacle (RAO) framework, grounded in a case study with a professional artist. By deliberately interfering with the creative process through real-time micro-phenomenological questioning, we pursue a dual objective. First, methodologically, we demonstrate that this intervention is feasible and preserves the ecological validity of the creative act. Second, and crucially, we show that the protocol generates data of unexpected granularity, granting access to the “creative engine”: the minute-to-minute oscillation between action (what the artist does) and affect (how the work’s evolving form redirects action). This deep analysis allows us to conceptualize the “fertile self”, a productive zone situated between the risks of self-citation (repetition) and self-alienation (loss of agency). Within this zone, the artist is guided by a pre-reflective \"feeling of life\" felt in relation to the artwork-in-the-making. Consequently, the study validates RAO not merely as an observational tool, but as a generative instrument for theory building: the data suggest that the fertile self is structurally similar to Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development where the relation to the artwork acts as the guiding peer. RAO is thus established as a key method for grounding creativity research in the dynamic, first-person experience of the maker.",

        "abstract": "It was often argued that smartphones facilitate access to a large number of resources whenever and wherever needed. In stressful instances, smartphone-enabled easy access could be particularly relevant as they could reduce the effort needed to access resources and thereby increase efficient coping with stressful instances. However, while this is often argued for it has not been tested. This research report builds on a secondary analysis of two experience sampling studies on the use of phones for coping with stress in two samples of mothers (NStudy1 = 50; NStudy2 = 225). Both studies asked mothers to report on stressful situations that had happened in the last two hours several times a day. We tested whether phone use in a stressful situation was related to less perceived coping effort and whether decreased coping effort related to more perceived coping efficacy. We find no support for the relation between effort and coping efficacy and mixed support for the relation of phone use and effort. Especially the inconclusive relationship between effort and smartphone use is surprising and challenges often used arguments in the mobile communication literature. Exploratory analyses suggest that the relationship between coping effort and phone use might be different depending on which coping strategy is applied.",

        "abstract": "Deciding how to assign students to teams for effective teamwork, also known as the Team Formation Problem (TFP) in education, remains insufficiently understood despite decades of research across different disciplines offering fragmented guidance. In higher education, instructors must form short-lived teams using limited data while balancing pedagogical goals and logistical constraints, conditions that differ sharply from professional team settings. To address this fragmentation, this study develops an integrated taxonomy of educational TFP grounded in a systematic review of 35 peer-reviewed studies. Building upon perspectives from Operations Research, Organizational Psychology, and Educational Research, the taxonomy organizes TFP variants into three interrelated pillars: (1) Input attributes, which specify the student attributes used to form teams; (2) Problem formulation, which describes how attributes are manipulated and formalizes pedagogical objectives and constraints into optimization model; and (3) Solution methods, which describe the algorithms used to generate feasible team assignments. This structure clarifies the modeling decisions that underpin different TFP variants and provides a common vocabulary for describing them, enabling transparent reporting and meaningful comparison between studies that previously lacked a shared frame of reference. This structure makes explicit how pedagogical rationales, such as fairness, peer learning, or cohesion, translate into concrete modeling decisions, enabling transparent reporting and like-for-like comparison across studies that were previously not comparable. The review reveals substantial heterogeneity in how TFP variants are defined and reported, and shows that the proposed taxonomy can classify all identified formulations while exposing cross-disciplinary inconsistencies and gaps. The paper concludes with methodological guidelines that standardize how TFP variants should be specified and reported, supporting transparent communication, comparative analysis, and future benchmarking of team formation methods in educational contexts.",

We analyse 3,300,695 days of actual household electricity use in Queensland, Australia, available in 5-minute intervals to identify five distinctly different household electricity consumption patterns. We then assign 366,439,750 days of electricity use of 1,097,125 households in Queensland, Australia, to those prototypical patterns to identify household market segments with distinct electricity use patterns and household characteristics. Segment profiles show that the benefits of rooftop photovoltaics are currently asymmetrically accessible to the Australian population in Queensland. Households with photovoltaic systems typically live in their own house, report a high education and income level, whereas households without photovoltaics who have the most consistent electricity use pattern across the day and use most electricity from the grid are more likely to rent, live in an apartment and report lower income and education levels. Regulatory modifications can make cost cost-saving benefits of rooftop solar systems available to a much wider section of the Australian community in Queensland, while also contributing to carbon emissions reduction via an increase in renewable energy.",

There has been minimal growth in social housing stock in Australia over the past three decades. This has led to a reduction in the share of the total dwelling stock and annual new dwelling supply.

        "abstract": "There are growing expectations that financial institutions and companies could, and should, play their part in finding solutions to biodiversity loss, for example, by investing in strategies that fully mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity and support the transition towards nature- positive economies. A key element of nature-related risk for investors and businesses is the \"materiality\" of their impacts on biodiversity. This includes financial, physical and reputational elements. Despite a proliferation of experimental tools for quantifying, assessing, and monitoring impacts on biodiversity (physical materiality), there is a gap as regards reputational materiality. Nature PRISM aims to complement existing approaches, by quantifying reputational materiality for industry, regulators, and investors. It is an automated data-driven tool, that assesses the perceived impact of corporate activity on biodiversity through a large-scale machine-learning analysis of publicly-available information. The tool is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph structured around a DAPSIR (Driver, Action, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) framework, providing a novel holistic approach to monitoring and reporting perceptions of biodiversity impacts. Importantly it picks up not just negative impacts, but also positive impacts and responses to biodiversity loss. We demonstrate the potential of Nature PRISM to reveal the extent of perceived correlations between drivers and biodiversity indicators across a wide range of sectors, using a novel dataset of over three million long-form news articles, identified through a set of expert- derived and industry-standard keywords. We also demonstrate the tool's potential to become a robust and comparable sector-specific indicator using a case study of housing developments in Europe. The tool has the potential to be a new and complementary evidence-based resource for investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders to assess reputational materiality and guide business decisions, disaggregatable by sector, geography, or individual company.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a structural theory of faculty governance decline in contemporary universities. Drawing on historical analysis and a review of comparative literature, the study argues that administrative dominance emerges not as institutional pathology but as rational adaptation to specific convergent conditions. Five structural factors are identified: the collapse of epistemic authority, institutional scale and heterogeneity, an intensified risk environment, the fragmentation of faculty as a collective class, and mission substitution dynamics. When these conditions converge, faculty governance becomes structurally impossible rather than merely politically undermined. The analysis synthesizes findings from recent cross-national studies documenting decollegialization, managerialism, and corporatization trends. The article concludes that reversing administrative expansion requires addressing the structural configuration that makes faculty governance unviable, rather than pursuing reforms within existing frameworks. This reframing carries significant implications for higher education policy and institutional design.",

        "abstract": "Canada's health research enterprise operates under a troubling paradox. For over a decade, federal mandates have required researchers to consider sex, gender, and diversity in their studies—yet no one has systematically verified whether these requirements translate into practice. The result is a system that may be producing research fundamentally misaligned with the population it claims to serve. When clinical trials and health studies fail to include representative samples, the treatments and interventions they validate may work differently—or not at all—for excluded groups. This is not merely an equity concern; it is a validity crisis that undermines the scientific foundation of Canadian healthcare. Our assessment of global health datasets and Canadian research infrastructure reveals that this problem stems not from researcher indifference, but from a critical gap between policy aspirations and operational capacity. Institutions lack the digital tools to measure diversity, leaving them unable to identify—let alone correct—systematic exclusions. Addressing this requires moving beyond compliance narratives toward investment in auditing infrastructure that can objectively verify representativeness.",

        "abstract": "All other things being equal, two-stage research funding processes that involve the initial submission of a relatively short proposal containing only minimal information (typically referred to as an outline proposal) followed by a preparation and submission of a full proposal will on average require less effort from their applicants than will single-stage processes. But it is likely that a funder operating a process which begins with a lower-effort outline stage will receive more applications than they might have expected to see had applicants been required initially to prepare a full proposal in a single-stage process. The net effect of these interacting and competing influences on the overall effort required in, and efficiency of, a funding process is not currently known and so is investigated in this work using an Agent-Based Modelling approach. The results of this model suggest that while the number of applications submitted will indeed increase, perhaps by as much as 40%, if two-stage processes are used, the level of applicant effort per unit output (that is, unit of funding awarded or number of awards made) may be reduced by around 15% to 20%. A weaker but more general interpretation, that does not rely so much on the specifics of the model, is that substantial increases in demand arising from use of outline processes might still come with an overall decrease in applicant effort. A reasonable conclusion is that more extensive use of two-stage research funding processes may lead to significant cost savings.",

However, existing research has largely prioritised individual motivations, paying less attention to the shared meanings through which such behaviours are socially constructed. Drawing on Social Representations Theory (SRT), this study examines how collective understandings of second-hand shopping are organised and how they relate to broader circular-economy consumption behaviours. Methods We report findings from a pre-registered study based on a nationally representative survey of Scottish adults (N = 1,516), which included a free-association task eliciting spontaneous meanings related to “buying second-hand.” The data were analysed using a mixed-method approach. Results The results reveal a structured social representation of second-hand shopping that is predominantly practice-oriented and economically anchored, with strong emphasis on affordability and waste avoidance, with environmental concerns emerging in central elements. Five distinct cognitive clusters were identified, differing in their configurations of economic, moral, environmental, and pragmatic meaning constructions. CE-related behavioural engagement (particularly buying used, buying less, and zero-waste practices) was more strongly associated with cluster formation than sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions Second-hand shopping is widely represented as an everyday, functional practice rather than an explicitly normative or policy-driven behaviour. While environmental meanings are increasingly integrated, collective representations remain grounded in resourcefulness and waste avoidance.",

This view resonates with the philosophical insights of Martin Heidegger and Ludwig Wittgenstein. When an agent equipped with the CPIPM algorithm is initially outfitted with perceptual sensors and preset with primary needs, it can generate language in accordance with the algorithm. In subsequent cognitive processes, the agent is capable of achieving re-cognition through language, thereby transcending the limitations of its initial sensors and pre-programmed parameters.

        "abstract": "Tourism and everyday life increasingly intersect in destination spaces, yet existing studies rarely capture how local people and tourists generate unequal access to services through their distinct mobility patterns. This study introduces a trajectory-based spatiotemporal mismatch (TBSTM) framework that links group-specific mobility rhythms to the spatial and temporal distribution of facilities. Using Amami Oshima, Japan, as a case, we integrate a year-long high-resolution mobility trajectory dataset with mobility network analysis, multimodal accessibility modelling, and a standardized trajectory-based supply-demand index to evaluate disparities in service access for both groups. Results show a clear dual structure of inequality. Local people experience persistent, place-specific shortages in essential services, particularly education, healthcare, and administrative functions-concentrated in peripheral communities such as North, Uken, and Kakeromajima. Tourists, in contrast, face seasonal and service-specific deficits in accommodation, food, and tourism amenities, which intensify from quarter 2 to quarter 4 around gateways and major tourist attractions. Network analysis further indicates that local people provide the stable backbone of the island’s mobility system, whereas tourist flows temporarily thicken key nodes without altering overall connectivity. The study extends spatial mismatch theory by embedding dynamic, group-specific mobility evidence into an operational TBSTM framework. It also offers a foundation for dynamic adaptive governance, enabling timely and targeted interventions to enhance equity and resilience in tourism-dependent destinations.",

There remain gaps in evidence, including how variation in implementation context affects FGC experiences and outcomes. The Family Views and Context Study is part of a wider realist-informed evaluation (Family VOICE). It involved 380 individuals who had attended FGCs, from 155 families across the UK. Family members completed questionnaires at three time points, including standardised measures for self-efficacy, family functioning, adult well-being and child psychosocial health. FGC coordinators also completed questionnaires. This paper focuses on one key aspect of variation in implementation context, namely the stage of child welfare concern. Three categories are compared: (1) early help and child in need; (2) child protection and edge of care; and (3) children in state care. In addition to questionnaires, a sub-group of participants (n=25) took part in semi-structured interviews, purposively sampled for these three stages of concern. Quantitative comparisons found almost no significant differences between the three categories in family experiences or outcomes. Qualitative interviews suggested more similarities than differences in participant experiences, perceptions of FGC mechanisms, and intended outcomes, across the three categories.",

        "abstract": "The First World War challenged internationalist ideals in chemistry, as nations mobilized researchers for military purposes. In different ways, chemists from various nations reconstructed international networks in the interwar period. A transnational comparison shows that German (Fritz Haber) and British (Frederick Donnan) chemistry coordinated their international efforts easily with state and industry, as the relations had intensified during the war. Chemists from Sweden (Svante Arrhenius) and the Netherlands (Ernst Cohen) turned to the cultural and epistemic meaning of neutrality to justify their internationalism at home and abroad. The comparative analysis emphasizes national histories in understanding the politics of international science.",

        "abstract": "This article presents the results of survey and excavation in the Chachapoyas region of the Peruvian eastern Andes attesting to human occupation of the mid-altitude cloud forest from at least the Middle Holocene. While the Peruvian eastern Andes have long been identified as an important region in the exchange of domesticated plants and animals between the Pacific coast, Andean highlands, and the Amazon rainforest, little direct evidence dating to before 1000 BP has been reported. In fact, the record of early groups in this tropical montane cloud forest environment is so scarce that some experts have suggested that this landscape was too marginal to support substantial pre- and proto-agricultural populations. Evidence from this study, including radiocarbon dating and faunal and botanical analyses, contradicts such models, showing that foragers were living in this environment from at least 5500 cal BP. Some domesticated species were present by the terminal Preceramic (ca 3600 cal BP), and mixed forager-producer subsistence persists in the Middle Horizon or Late Intermediate Period (1400–500 cal BP).",

        "abstract": "Diabetes affects millions of people worldwide and receives significant public attention due to its complexity and association with multiple comorbidities. However, it is often framed in public discourse as a condition stemming primarily from individual behaviors and manageable through personal lifestyle changes. The media plays a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing such perceptions, yet its role in constructing narratives around diabetes care and responsibility remains underexplored. In this study, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of reports published in two widely circulated national newspapers in Türkiye representing opposing political orientations to examine how diabetes is represented in the media. We analyzed the framing of disease causes, risks, and treatment approaches, as well as thematic orientations and sourcing practices in news production. Our findings indicate that diabetes is consistently presented through an individualized lens across both outlets. News coverage relies heavily on single-expert sourcing, while public health perspectives, social determinants of health, and structural prevention measures receive limited attention. Conceptual imprecision in reporting frequently blurs distinctions between causes, risks, symptoms, and complications, undermining health literacy and contributing to confusion about disease prevention and management. Treatment and prevention are commonly framed through lifestyle and dietary suggestions that are weakly connected to evidence-based care. In addition, attention-grabbing narratives rarely distinguish between diabetes subtypes, further reinforcing misinterpretations of risk and responsibility. Notably, these patterns persist despite the newspapers’ opposing political orientations. Overall, the findings underscore the need for more accurate, contextualized, and evidence-informed health communication on diabetes.",

        "abstract": "For the Anishinaabek Nation, forests are sites of social, ancestral, and more-than-human relationships that sustain Life. For Canadian governments, forests are sites of timber extraction that sustain industry. Canadian legislators fail to see the forest for the trees. This case study examines cumulative impacts of Ontario’s forestry legislation on Anishinaabek life ways, focusing our study on food ways. Food ways include cultural, economic, scientific, linguistic, spiritual, and intergenerational dimensions of food in a society. Anishinaabek food ways are affirmed in the 1850 Robinson Huron Treaty, a land sharing agreement between the Anishinaabek Nation and the British Crown. Crown responsibilities for resource ‘management’ was given to Provinces following the BNA Act (1867). We demonstrate ways Ontario forestry legislation disregards the Crown’s Treaty-affirmed obligations to uphold Anishinaabek harvesting rights. This case study begins with Elders’ reflections on glyphosate use in forestry. Forest operators claim herbicide use speeds commercial species regeneration, yet this strategy converts food and medicine-bearing forests to pine plantations lacking the biodiversity upon which Anishinaabek food ways depend. We ask how changes to Ontario’s forestry legislation impact Crown obligations under the Robinson Huron Treaty (1850) to protect Anishinaabek food ways. We examine limitations of settler colonial knowledge systems for understanding the impacts of forest ‘management’ decisions. This research demonstrates a need for settler scholars and forest practitioners to update their understandings of Crown responsibilities through Indigenous peoples’ Treaty perspectives. Respecting Anishinaabek food ways means adjusting how settler society views forests.",

        "abstract": "Research has increasingly demonstrated that visual art in healthcare settings can support wellbeing through psychological and physiological benefits such as reduced stress, improved mood, and enhanced care perceptions. However, there remains debate regarding which types of art are most suitable, given the subjectivity of preferences and diversity of healthcare settings. This exploratory case study examined how patient and staff interactions with a waiting room exhibition impact their experiences of the health center environment at a London GP practice. A convergent mixed-methods design captured experiences from staff, patients, and visitors through questionnaires, response forms, and a visitor journal. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, while qualitative responses underwent inductive thematic analysis. Results indicated staff primarily viewed the exhibition as enhancing aesthetics and providing positive distraction for patients, with no consensus on the importance of specific artistic aspects (Cochran's Q(6) = 21.33, p &lt; .001; Friedman χ²(5) = 4.89, p = .43). Thematic analysis generated four themes per population. Staff themes included workplace viewing patterns affecting engagement and accessibility, broad emotional benefits moderated by preference, appreciation of content and intellectual provocation, and curatorial sensitivity supporting holistic patient care. Patient and visitor themes included contextual significance of medical space, user-dependent emotional and psychological benefits, curiosity and artistry appreciation, and personal relationship to the artist. Cross-population triangulation indicated complex convergence on content appreciation and emotional impact, with distinct considerations emerging based on each group's unique relationship to the healthcare environment. With the exception of a couple negative responses, the exhibition positively influenced user experiences, offering emotional, intellectual, and aesthetic benefits. Overall, carefully curated art that balances intellectual stimulation, emotional benefits, and contextual sensitivity can enhance wellbeing in primary care settings. Recommendations include rotating diverse exhibitions, gathering stakeholder input before commissioning, creating intentional viewing opportunities for staff, and integrating arts programming into healthcare facility design standards.",
