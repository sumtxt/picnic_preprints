        "abstract": "This paper uses the staggered implementation of gender quota policy in India to understand whether women who won office due to quotas go on to win higher-level office. Indian local government elections impose mandatory gender quotas, but state elections do not. This provides a setting to assess if there is an increase in women's representation at higher levels of governance due to quotas at the local level. The identification strategy allows me to ascribe an increase of three percentage points in the share of women at the state-level to gender quotas in local government. Additionally, to establish upward political mobility of local-level leaders I tracked political biographies of over 1000 women legislators across India's 15 major state assemblies. In doing so, I identify that political dynasties, and ground-level leadership --- those who entered politics due to mandatory gender quotas --- are the two primary channels that enable entry of women into state-level politics. Further, I show that the effect of democratic entry of women into politics via quotas is pronounced in states with parties that are reliant on empowered rank and file members. Overall, these results highlight the importance of gender quotas as a democratic state-building tool and provide evidence for career advancement of women in politics whose democratic entry into politics was facilitated by the implementation of mandatory gender quotas.",

Especially, apart from traditional forms of political participation such as voting and petitions, we have also seen a burgeoning literature on protests, a non-institutional and contentious form of political participation. Despite various ethical concerns with recreating artificially contentious environments for conducting experiments, this burgeoning literature is robust and still growing to cover all analytic issues about the genesis and effects of protests. This essay provides a comprehensive framework and a critical review for the recent experimental literature on protests in social sciences.",

        "abstract": "Political trust is widely considered essential for democracy, but empirical evidence testing this hypothesis remains limited. Building on research on political trust as related to democratic legitimacy and on trust’s attitudinal and behavioral consequences, we formulate expectations about longitudinal effects of political trust on democracy. Our primary hypothesis is that political trust has a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already achieved some level of democracy. To test this hypothesis, we employ Bayesian latent trend analysis to estimate a time series of political trust for 62 countries over 30 years. We fit lagged variable models to the trust time series combined with democracy measures from the Varieties of Democracy project and economic indicators. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a positive effect among already democratic countries.",

        "abstract": "\"Divided We Fall: A Multidisciplinary Analysis of Polarisation, Social Divides, and the Fragility of Unity in Human Societies\" explores the escalating threat of polarisation and tribalism in modern human societies. By examining historical case studies, such as Nazi Germany and McCarthyism, alongside contemporary events like Brexit and the U.S. elections of 2016 and 2024, the paper identifies recurring patterns in how societal divisions are exploited for political and ideological gain. The analysis integrates insights from social psychology, highlighting cognitive biases like confirmation bias, in-group/out-group dynamics and heuristic-driven decision-making, which leave individuals vulnerable to manipulation. The paper also delves into the role of emerging technologies, such as social media and AI-driven propaganda, in amplifying divisions, creating echo chambers and eroding democratic norms. Beyond diagnosing the problem, it explores opportunities for fostering unity, drawing on historical examples of collective action, such as post-WWII reconstruction and the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the fragility of social cohesion and emphasize the urgent need for proactive leadership, media responsibility and grassroots mobilisation to counter polarisation. This multidisciplinary framework aims to provoke discussion on how humanity can navigate its growing divides and build resilience against future existential threats. The paper also explores how modern technologies—such as social media algorithms and artificial intelligence—amplify polarization, creating echo chambers and eroding trust in democratic processes. Insights from social psychology, including heuristics, cognitive biases, and tribalism, highlight the vulnerabilities that make societies susceptible to manipulation. Finally, the paper discusses pathways to unity through shared goals, historical examples of successful collaboration, and the necessity of ethical leadership and robust institutions. The findings underscore the urgent need for proactive measures to counteract polarization, emphasizing education, transparency, and collective action as essential tools for preserving democracy and fostering global unity in the face of existential threats such as climate change and technological disruption.",

        "abstract": "Although central bank communication is a core monetary policy and accountability tool for central banks, little is known about what shapes it. This paper develops and tests a theory regarding a previously unconsidered variable: central bank independence (CBI). We argue that increases in CBI alter the pressures a central bank faces, compelling them to address these pressures to maintain their reputation. We fine-tune and validate a Large Language Model (Google's Gemini) to develop novel textual indices of policy pressures regarding monetary policy communication of central banks in speeches of 100 central banks from 1997 to 2023. Employing a staggered difference-in-differences and an instrumental variable approach, we find robust evidence that an increase in independence decreases monetary pressures and increases financial pressures discussed in monetary policy communication. These results are not, as generally is assumed, confounded by general changes in communication over time or singular events, in particular, the Global Financial Crisis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Customer value co-creation (CVCC) intention has been shown to foster favorable consumer attitudes towards businesses, thereby promoting positive consumer behavior. However, research on the application of this phenomenon in the e-commerce domain remains limited. Grounded in social exchange and social identity theories, this study investigates the mediating role of satisfaction in the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) and CVCC intention, as well as the moderating effect of gender on this mediation within the e-commerce context. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey was conducted using non-probability convenience sampling, involving 309 students from Keimyung University in Korea. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using SPSS-AMOS, and the proposed hypotheses were tested through SPSS PROCESS Model 7. Findings The findings of this study indicate that satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between perceived CSR and CVCC intention. Additionally, this mediation is moderated by gender, with the effect of perceived CSR on CVCC intention through satisfaction being stronger for female participants than for male participants. Originality/value This study extends social exchange and social identity theories to the e-commerce domain by elucidating the mechanisms through which CSR influences CVCC intention. It highlights the pivotal role of satisfaction in linking CSR with CVCC intention and emphasizes the moderating influence of gender. Practical recommendations are provided for e-commerce businesses to enhance the effectiveness of their CSR initiatives in fostering consumer engagement.",

        "abstract": "Single-use disposable cups are a significant contributor to plastic waste due to their widespread use and limited recyclability. Policymakers worldwide are implementing measures to reduce their consumption and encourage reusable alternatives. This study evaluates the impact of regulatory measures (charges and discounts), persuasion (environmental information prompts), and consumer motivations (using Protection Motivation Theory) on preferences for single-use, refillable, and returnable cups. Using discrete choice experiments with a nationally representative sample, we find that a charge of 25–30 pence is required to reduce single-use cup selection by 50%, whereas a discount of at least 70 pence achieves a similar effect. Information prompts have minimal influence on choices, while environmentally motivated consumer segments demonstrate greater responsiveness to discounts. These findings provide actionable, evidence-based insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders, supporting the design of effective interventions to accelerate the transition from single-use to reusable systems.",

        "abstract": "If a government highlighted the first producer to adopt green technology, how would the remaining producers react? This study is the first attempt to evaluate the impact of a message sent by the government to an industry about a first mover in climate action. Among 374 wineries in Japan, randomly selected half received a message mentioning the winery that was an early adopter of renewable energy. We then observed whether other wineries participated in webinars on carbon footprint measurement to collect information. We find that this message about climate leadership did not encourage the wineries to participate in the webinar, and it even had a negative effect on nearby wineries. We interpret these results as reflecting both the strategic decisions of competing wineries and the adverse psychological effects of the message. This preregistered experiment suggests that we must be cautious when designing policies to honor first movers on the supply side.",

The domestic credit percentage involving the private sector to GDP allows projects of high risk but with a very high reward, projects that are key in increasing productivity and global competitiveness significantly. This paper explores that dynamic in infrastructure, creative industries, and greening technologies. Indeed, findings from such studies do show positive correlations, such as between credit and infrastructure development or creative exports, suggesting the capability of systems of finance to transform. These findings indicate the positive relationships that exist in some contexts, such as reduced R&amp;D investment. Taking into account the ecological bottom line, this research underlines ecosystem-based strategies of banking, green credit, and poised financial regulations for sustainable development. Synthesizing into this paper provides actionable insight into how policy makers, financial institutions, and researchers can tap into the synergy between the financial system and innovation.",

        "abstract": "The mental wellbeing of adolescents and young adults has gained increasing academic attention, yet literature examining the lifetime labor market costs attributable to mental disorders remains scarce. This study documents the labor market deficits of mental disorders in both the short and the very long term using Finnish administrative data on hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and labor market outcomes. A history of psychiatric hospitalization is associated with approximately 50 % deficit in lifetime income relative to non-diagnosed control group, and this deficit is larger, the earlier that hospitalization occurs. Event study estimates suggest that labor market performance tends to deteriorate before the first psychiatric treatment, which undermines causal interpretations in the differencein-differences framework. Disorders related to acute stress are an exception, and do not exhibit pretrends; however, these disorders often originate from traumatic life-events that may also have direct impact on individuals’ work capacity, leaving the interpretation of the point estimates ambiguous.",

La transizione verso pratiche di finanza sostenibile è analizzata nel contesto della crescente rilevanza della sostenibilità come driver strategico per la competitività delle banche. Attraverso un'analisi econometrica basata su modelli panel data, il paper indaga la relazione tra le componenti ESG e il valore dei mutui concessi alle famiglie. I risultati mostrano che i mutui sono influenzati positivamente da politiche di supporto creditizio, interventi di riqualificazione urbana e una maggiore educazione finanziaria nelle regioni con elevata disuguaglianza di reddito e grave deprivazione abitativa. Tuttavia, emergono anche criticità legate a rischi ambientali e di governance che possono ridurre la domanda di mutui in aree con problemi significativi di gestione dei rifiuti e deterioramento del paesaggio. Il paper conclude con una discussione sulle implicazioni di policy e suggerimenti per ulteriori ricerche nel campo della finanza sostenibile e dei suoi effetti sul settore bancario e sulla domanda di credito.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces {censobr}, an R package that provides an efficient method for accessing and analyzing Brazilian census data. The package enables in-disk data manipulation, allowing users to handle larger-than-memory datasets seamlessly with familiar {dplyr} syntax. The package integrates with {geobr}, enriching census data with geographic identifiers for easy spatial analysis. It offers a range of functions to download microdata and aggregated data for all of the Brazilian census editions since 1960 and provides access to essential documentation such as variable dictionaries and interview manuals. Through this approach, {censobr} enhances accessibility to detailed demographic and socioeconomic information, including both individual-level microdata and census tract-level aggregates. Additionally, the package's handling of complex survey designs and support for spatial data visualization facilitates in-depth analysis of the sociodemographic characteristics and living conditions of the Brazilian population over several decades. Practical examples included in the paper demonstrate its applications in areas such as demographic analysis and household-level research. {censobr} represents a significant advancement in making Brazilian census data accessible and efficient for academic and policy-related research. Future updates will expand its functionality and data coverage, contributing further to the ease of use and analytical capabilities of the package.",

        "abstract": "An increasing number of studies have examined fertility variation at the regional level within countries, but this research has largely focused on women. As a result, our knowledge of regional variation in male fertility remains limited. The current study addresses this research gap by examining how the timing and chances of parenthood vary regionally for women and men in four countries in Northern and Western Europe. We hypothesise that men may be subject to less regional variation in their first births than women, and that gender differences in first births may be less pronounced in urban centres, such as the capital regions, and especially among groups with higher levels of education. The study is based on data collected from female and male cohorts born between 1963 and 1970 in Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The results broadly support our hypotheses: men show modestly smaller differences in the timing and chances of first parenthood between capital and other regions than women, and consequently smaller gender differences in first parenthood exist in capital regions in all countries except the Netherlands. Moreover, highly educated women and men living in the capital regions have the most similar timing and chances of entering parenthood.",

        "abstract": "Criminologists maintain a vested interest in hard-to-reach populations, such as active offenders, former prisoners, and affiliates of criminal enterprises. For five decades, policymakers and researchers have sought national estimates of gang activity. Traditional methods, such as surveys sampling law enforcement agencies or youth populations, have provided valuable insights into gang activity in the United States. However, these approaches face limitations, including bias, obsolescence, high costs, outdated data, and restricted scope. This study examines the potential of online opt-in panels to studying gang populations. Contracting with YouGov, we administered four surveys to 13,148 respondents between January 2023 and January 2024, measuring lifetime gang membership and its correlates. Lifetime gang membership estimates ranged from 2.0% to 2.4% in custom surveys and 5.3% to 6.2% in omnibus surveys. While demographic and socioeconomic correlates showed mixed results, ecological and legal correlates consistently aligned with expectations based on prior research. Our findings suggest cautious optimism about the utility of online opt-in panels for studying hard-to-reach populations like gang members and advancing cross-national, comparative research in line with the Eurogang Program of Research. These panels offer advantages such as cost-efficiency, accessibility, and timeliness, but further validation is necessary to establish their reliability and validity for population-level estimates.",

Since this is one of the most common statistical analyses, Stata offers a wide variety of methods to investigate such effects. The present study outlines how these different analyses can be performed in Stata and provides a comprehensive simulation study to determine which method has the best statistical properties. To this end, both the nominal alpha error rate and statistical power are assessed for continuous and binary dependent variables. For a deeper analysis, not only are the sample sizes varied, but other potential challenges are also considered, such as heteroscedasticity for the continuous outcome and imbalanced binary outcome variables. The results indicate that some methods deviate significantly from the nominal alpha limit, leading to incorrect conclusions on average. For the continuous outcome variable, the OLS regression approach with robust (HC3) standard errors and an interaction term yields the best results. For the binary outcome, we recommend the logit model with robust standard errors or the linear probability model with robust (HC3) standard errors.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides an analytical exploration of how network characteristics influence residential segregation. Building upon the foundational Schelling model, I develop an Agent-based simulation wherein agents are embedded within a social network structure. This approach allows for the experimental manipulation of network features such as homophily, clustering, and degree, enabling the assessment of their individual and combined impacts on segregation levels, patterns, and the stability of the socio-spatial system. I find that certain configurations of these network features can exacerbate residential sorting to levels exceeding those predicted by the original Schelling model. These outcomes underscore the critical role of social network dynamics, particularly the significance of weak ties, in driving a system toward a segregated state. The results contribute to the broader sociological discourse on social networks, highlighting the complex interplay between network structure and social phenomena, and offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying residential segregation.",

        "abstract": "Citizenship has become a key concept for studying the relationship between individuals and the state. The notion of lived citizenship, in particular, highlights how the rights and obligations of citizenship are lived differently based on race, gender, class and other markers of social difference. However, much of the existing scholarship remains rooted in global North contexts, with limited attention to the realities of living under weak institutions. This research note builds on critical citizenship studies and foundational works on citizenship in the global South to offer an original conceptual framework for studying lived citizenship. It starts with a rethinking of the classical division of civil, social and political rights of citizenship into four fields of relating to the state: protection, provision, participation and belonging. It then illustrates how our experiences of these four fields are structured by four interconnected elements: social locations, relations, practices, and emotions. It conceptualizes these four fields and elements in ways that address dynamics of informality, clientelism, extralegal violence and authoritarianism that often mediate the relationship with the state in the global South. By bridging key theoretical and empirical gaps, this conceptualization offers new insights for organizing our inquiry into citizenship as lived and contested across the globe.",

        "abstract": "Background: Evidence shows that community group activities can support and improve health and wellbeing. However, research into the patterning of community engagement suggests that socioeconomic factors may act as barriers to participation. Yet, because this research has mainly been conducted in high-income, Western and Global North countries, it remains unclear whether these patterns are consistent across different countries and cultural settings, especially in Global South, low-middle income, and non-Western countries. Further, we do not know whether country-level socioeconomic factors influence community engagement. Methods: Data from 64,065 adult respondents in the World Values Survey were analysed to examine the association between individual-level (education, income, and employment) and country-level (years of compulsory education, GDP per capita, Gini coefficient, and unemployment) socioeconomic factors and community organization membership rates. Multilevel regression modelling was used. Further analyses tested the associations between active membership and various types of community organization memberships. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, immigration status, household size and marital status. Results: Prevalence of community organization membership varies across countries. Kenya, Colombia and Mongolia have the highest numbers of memberships and Greece, Russia and Egypt have the lowest numbers. Individual education and perceived household income, and country-level income inequality and employment rate were all positively associated with group membership. Some variations by organization type were observed. Conclusions: We found a universal social gradient in community organization membership, with individual education as the most influential predictor of more memberships across countries. Given that participation in community organizations can improve and support individual and community wellbeing, and plays a role in cultural and social capital development, reducing participatory disparities in these organizations could contribute to the reduction of health and social inequalities.",

        "abstract": "L'articolo esplora l'importanza strategica dell'implementazione dei servizi di kitting e assembly per affrontare problematiche di assegnazione delle risorse in un magazzino operante nel settore idrotermosanitario. Si concentra sulla crescente complessità delle operazioni logistiche in un contesto caratterizzato da una domanda sempre più personalizzata e dalla necessità di garantire tempi di consegna rapidi. Attraverso un'analisi approfondita, il lavoro evidenzia come il kitting e l'assembly siano strumenti fondamentali per ottimizzare i flussi operativi, migliorare l'efficienza e soddisfare le aspettative dei clienti. Il kitting viene descritto come il processo di raggruppamento di componenti per assemblaggi specifici, contribuendo alla riduzione dei tempi operativi e minimizzando gli errori umani. L'assembly, d'altro canto, completa il ciclo producendo kit semi-finiti o finiti, pronti per la distribuzione. L'articolo analizza il valore di questa integrazione, mostrando come essa migliori la gestione degli spazi e la tracciabilità dei materiali, oltre a fornire un vantaggio competitivo. La ricerca adotta un approccio olistico, prendendo in esame sia gli aspetti tecnologici, come l’uso di software di gestione logistico avanzato, sia quelli collaborativi, evidenziando l'importanza del coordinamento tra risorse umane e materiali. Inoltre, include casi studio dettagliati che dimostrano i benefici tangibili delle soluzioni implementate, come la riduzione degli errori, l’aumento dell’efficienza e un impatto positivo sulla sostenibilità. Questo lavoro rappresenta un contributo significativo per le aziende che intendono migliorare la gestione logistica, con un focus su innovazione e ottimizzazione dei processi.",

        "created": "2024-11-22",
        "abstract": "To address social concerns that online personalisation algorithms increase polarisation, scholars have studied two distinct classes of agent based models of opinion dynamics constructed to explain polarisation: contagion/reinforcement class and repulsion class. It has been rigorously demonstrated that these classes make contrasting predictions on the relationship between polarisation and homophily (thought to be a consequence of online personalisation algorithms). However, consequences of a model that combines contagion and repulsion on the relationship between homophily and polarisation has not been rigorously studied. Thus, this paper proposes a theoretical foundation for such a model and extends an existing contagion class attitude dynamics model into a contagion-repulsion combination model. This results in a novel equation of attitude change which positions the combination model as a generalisation of several other opinion dynamics models. Subsequently, simulation experiments test implications of this model on the relationship between homophily and polarisation. Results show different parameter combinations produce several qualitatively different forms of the relationship, ranging from increasing, decreasing, U-shaped or even flat. This suggests the relationship between polarisation and homophily is sensitive to context and may be issue dependent.",

        "abstract": "Our leap into emergency online teaching (EOT) during the COVID-19 pandemic was like tumbling down a rabbit hole into a surreal digital landscape, where synchronous and asynchronous teaching spaces became our new wonderland, each presenting its challenges and surprises. However, we merely encountered countless tips and professional development advice about how technology and AI tools can replace face-to-face instruction, foregrounding a technocentric discourse that ignored the centrality of educational theories for online teaching to consolidate student learning. In this paper, I argue that prevailing educational conditions, influenced by technological advancements, can find valuable support in Freire’s age-old yet enduring educational philosophy. Such a philosophy requires us to reimagine how to shift from policing knowledge to embracing new pedagogies that instil in our students the ethics and values they need to navigate the vast information readily available for consumption. I conclude that, like Alice and the Mad Hatter, we must embrace creativity and curiosity to cultivate robust online educational spaces that foster values, ethics, and proactive dispositions essential for thriving in today’s fast-paced, technology-driven world.",

        "abstract": "This article reviews Loet Leydesdorff’s contributions to science mapping. It explains how over the years, his mapping techniques evolved from journal mapping to overlays over global maps of science and finally towards interactive interfaces portraying multiple classifications and ontologies. It then critically reviews the challenges of current approaches to science mapping, which implicitly assume a ‘natural’ underlying structure, with examples from recent case studies. We observe that existing algorithmic approaches, either based on citation or semantic approaches, have problems of logic consistency of the categories obtained, which belong to methods, materials, empirical objects or theories. I propose that science mapping should engage with the conceptual goals of analyses that could define the type of ontologies relevant for each specific study. To do this science mapping should embrace mixed-methods to generate plural classifications and multiple ontologies which respond more specifically to sociological and policy questions.",

        "abstract": "This AHURI research examines how governments can encourage small-scale private investors to provide affordable rental housing. It finds that landlords who follow the positively geared, long-term hold investment (LTHI) model are most likely to be part of affordable housing schemes. The LTHI landlords invest on the basis of positive cashflow earning reliable rental income. In general, they purchase cheaper housing in lower value locations and seek to own their investment property outright by retirement. LTHIs landlords can provide a source of affordable rental housing, but do not tend to lead the creation of new stock. The landlords will participate in affordable housing schemes that maximise the potential for a positive cashflow, and not those based on financial schemes such as negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. It is important to index rental increases to market rates so that investors who lock-in to long-term schemes are not disincentivised. Focus groups with small-scale landlords who lease their properties to social housing providers (SHPs) found the landlords were unanimous in their support for headlease programs. The advantages for landlords included: - guaranteed rental payments provided cashflow security—such rental guarantees made investors 12 per cent more likely to participate in a scheme - no loss of rent due to vacancy and no need to advertise for new tenants - guaranteed make-good provisions gave confidence that the property would be returned in original condition - reduced administration demands provided peace of mind and a ‘hands free’ approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores social norms on social media, emphasizing the need for inductive research to capture the nuanced processes of norm adoption and adherence. Adopting a qualitative mixed-method approach, the study combines screen recordings, eye-tracking, think-aloud protocols, and semi-structured interviews to analyze how users perceive and adapt to social norms. Findings from 21 participants reveal distinct patterns of norm adoption with participants actively inferring platform-specific norms through visual cues (e.g., type of photos) and contextual signals (e.g., comments). Conversely, norm adherence on familiar platforms appears to involve more unconscious, habitual inferences shaped by both close peer influence and platform-specific expectations. The study highlights variations in norm processes across platforms, where Instagram promotes curated, idealized self-presentation, while TikTok encourages authenticity. Moreover, individual characteristics, platform affordances, and peer influence were found to shape self-presentation and self-disclosure and social norm adherence in diverse ways, underscoring the complexity and at times the striking uniqueness of digital self-expression of individual people. In sum, this research contributes to social norm theory by differentiating between norm adoption and adherence and by underscoring the impact of both interpersonal connections and platform culture on online behaviors.",

The study also explored if a non-familial environment in a childcare institution affected the mental health of the child and identified specific areas of concern. The case study was designed using interviews. The methodology entailed collecting primary data through administration of two Questionnaires namely the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Based on the data obtained from the interview transcripts, and field notes, an intense content analysis was done to examine the thought process of the child. The SDQ and BDI analysis revealed that the child is at high risk of developing clinically significant problems, including hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, and depression, due to non-traditional gender identity, lack of familial acceptance, violence, and alienation in the childcare institutions for boys, which may lead to mental health issues.",

This is also the case for corporately owned platforms designed to facilitate citizen engagement in civic issues. In contrast, civic platforms rooted in a FOSS approach are configurable and can be adapted in context to produce tailored interactions. In this paper, we examine what this adaptability means for citizenship when citizens can be involved in the making and running of platforms, and can take an active role in city governance using civic platforms. We revisit the analytical framework developed by Cardullo and Kitchin (2019a) – the scaffold of smart citizen participation – to consider the platformisation of urban living designed to empower citizens to take an active role in management and governance processes and decision-making. In particular, we focus on the scaffold’s least explored rungs, ‘citizen power’, providing a comparative analysis of instances of Decidim, a civic platform designed to engender collaborative governance, along with its associated soft infrastructure, in Barcelona, New York and Brazil. We highlight how different instances of the same platform can confer different citizenship relations depending on how it is framed, configured and used. In other words, platform citizenship is provincialized, enabling alternative futures to emerge from mainstream knowledge claims about citizens’ role in platform urbanisation.",
