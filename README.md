# Paper Picnic

A weekly basket with the latest Social and Behavioral Sciences preprints on [OSF](https://osf.io/preprints). On Fridays at 2 AM UTC, we query the [OSF API](https://developer.osf.io/) for new preprints that appeared in the previous 7 days. [preprints.paper-picnic.com/](https://preprints.paper-picnic.com/)

The crawler lives in the `main` branch of the backend while the website is rendered from the `gh-pages` branch.

After forking the repository, you need go to Settings > Actions > General. Scroll down to Workflow permissions and allow workflows to read and write in the repository.
